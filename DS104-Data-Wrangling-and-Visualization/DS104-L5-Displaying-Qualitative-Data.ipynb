    "Heat maps are pretty intuitive. As a child, you were taught that anything hot is dangerous (fire, stove, etc.) and so you probably connote red as danger, and green as safe. Even today, when you are using your GPS in your phone to map out a route to your destination, the roads that are red are crowded and should be avoided, whereas the roads that are green indicate traffic is flowing freely. Another example is traffic lights - red is stop, and danger, green is go, and safe.  This thought process makes heat maps easy to interpret! \n",

    "This heat map shows each country's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which is supposed to be a good preliminary indicator for overall economic health, with emphasis on manufacturing. The worldwide economy was a mess in 2008. Note that the existence of colors makes it so that on a macro level, it doesn't really matter what the numbers are. It is easy to see here that from Oct 08 to about Jun 09, things were not great, since they are all red. However, certain regions showed improvement from Mar 10 to Apr 11, particularly the US and Europe, although Greece, Italy, and Spain continued to struggle for most of the next 5 or 6 years.\n",

    "If one or both factors are categorical, it is customary to have some sort of ordering. For instance, in the heat map shown above, they are more or less grouped by region. Countries could also be ordered by population, GDP or some other economic indicator, or just about anything. Listing countries alphabetically doesn't really make much sense though, because it doesn't account for some logical ordering. This is a case where the ordering of a categorical variable should help illustrate some sort of narrative.\n",

    "# Issues with Heat Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the caveats about heat maps is this: Most tools that automatically create a heat map take the entire range of numbers, and set the lowest equal to the reddest shading, and the highest is set to the greenest shading. So, shading is a helpful tool, but you should look closely at what the particular numbers are before drawing solid conclusions. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A 10 by 10 grid box is represented in colors. The column headings are labeled period 1, period 2, period 3, period 4, period 5, period 6, period 7, period 8, period 9, and period 10. The row headings are labeled location 1, location 2, location 3, location 4, location 5, location 6, location 7, location 8, location 9, and location 10.](Media/L07-03.png)\n",

    "This is a typical heat map, with made up numbers that don't mean anything. Note the region of low numbers (red), and the region of high numbers (green).\n",

    "\n",
    "The numbers are different, but the shading is identical. Each cell in this second spreadsheet is exactly four times the number in the corresponding cell of the first spreadsheet, plus twenty-five. The point being made here is this: It is dangerous to compare two different heat maps to each other, because the 'red' cells in one heat map can reflect values that differ greatly from the 'red' cells in another heat map. Never compare two different heat maps to each other.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Creating the heat map automatically sets the smallest number to 'red,' and the largest number to 'green.' Everything in between those numbers is scaled using some sort of color gradient. In this case, it is red - orange - yellow - yellow/green - green. The extremes cause every other cell to be yellow or slightly orange, but the differences are subtle. The total range for all cells but the two corner cells is only 25, whereas the range for the entire sheet is 243.\n",
    "\n",
    "The moral of this story is that heat maps are **EXTREMELY** sensitive to outliers. So sensitive that the outliers tend to wash out any other information available by using a heat map. In other words, heat maps are best for situations where data are fairly well-behaved, and the user is looking for clustering of high or low numbers. Your eyeball analysis is much better at doing this for colors than it is for raw numbers.\n",

    "Several of the rectangles have writing within their border. For the bigger rectangles, both the overall percentage and subset specifics are spelled out. This is common with tree maps. Sometimes creators make the mistake of trying to cram as much info as possible until the font size is unreadable - this kind of defeats the purpose of visualization in the first place, but the attraction to include as much info as possible is strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common problem with tree maps is too many categories. As you look at this tree map, you can see 13 distinct colors for the rectangles on the tree map. On the other hand, the legend has 34 different colors, many of which are pretty indistinguishable from each other. For instance, look at the colors for ```Electronics``` and ```Boilers```. On the legend, their difference is subtle, but if they were on the tree map, it would be difficult to tell them apart.\n",

The red colors are most densely populated with elderly, whereas the blue colors are least densely populated with the elderly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the heat maps, the colors are relative, and without a key, the tree map is good for relative comparisons, but not absolute comparisons.

    "# Mosaic Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "A mosaic plot is a graphical method of displaying two or more categorical variables. It gives a quick and dirty overview of the data, and makes it possible to recognize relationships between different variables. A good example is that independence is shown when the boxes across categories all have the same areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a typical mosaic plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A graph depicts the plot of industry against nation. The x-axis represents four industries and is labeled automobiles, electronics, food, and oil. The y-axis represents nation they are labeled Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and U S.](Media/L07-14.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes mosaic plots require a bit of scrutiny, but they can convey a bunch of fascinating information. For example, in the mosaic plot above, production in four different industries is presented for five different nations. Each nation is represented by a different color, and each vertical stack represents a different industry. Take a closer look:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The purple boxes are for U.S. production. As a proportion of the total production of these five countries, the U.S. produces a lot more food and oil than autos. This is shown by the fact that the height of the food and oil portions for the U.S. is much taller than the autos portion. You might say that the production of food and oil is disproportionately large for the U.S.\n",
    "* Food production for Germany is negligible. In fact, the biggest contribution for production from Germany is autos.\n",
    "* Britain's largest contribution is food.\n",
    "* The width of the columns is sized to be relative to production. Therefore, the greatest production is in the food industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "There aren't too many options for enhancing a mosaic plot. Some mosaic plots show a scale on either the horizontal axis or the vertical axis (or both) to give an idea of the numbers or percentages being represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Input for a Mosaic Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "The input data for a mosaic plot typically consists of a table with three columns. The first two columns are the categorical variables, and the third column is usually a count, or a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mosaic Plots with a Third Categorical Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible, but a little clumsy, to add a third categorical variable into a mosaic plot. For example, suppose you wanted to graphically represent the passengers on the Titanic. Suppose you have three categorical variables: The class (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and crew), gender (male and female), and survival (yes and no). This is clearly three different categorical variables, but two of them can be reduced to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, consider the gender and survival variables. They can easily be combined to have four different levels:\n",

    "* female-yes\n",
    "* female-no\n",

    "\n",
    "You might notice that the column width integrity is lost a bit here. For example, the width of the female first class section is much wider than the male first class section, but that is not because there were three times as many women in first class as there were men. What it means is that women passengers were heavily weighted to first, second, and third class passengers. There were very few female crew members.  The table above shows that there were only 23 of them, out of the 470 women on board.\n",
