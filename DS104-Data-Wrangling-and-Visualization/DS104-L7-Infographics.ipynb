    "# What are Infographics? \n",
    "\n",
    "An *infographic* is simply a visual used to communicate information and/or data.  An infographic typically goes above and beyond the data visualizations you have learned in R, Python, and Tableau, since they are not tied down to the traditional chart types you have thus far encountered to deal with data. Can you use some of those traditional charts within your infographic? Absolutely! Does the entire visual revolve around a traditional chart? Absolutely not! \n",
    "\n",
    "With attention spans getting shorter and shorter, it is critical that you can convey all the important information at a glance.  Perusers of your findings should not have to undergo any intense study to understand what is going on with your data! This is true of all data visualizations, but infographics take it to the next level.  They rely on simple graphics, easy-to-read text, and enough space to make perusing the data a joy, not a chore.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use an Infographic\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use an infographic to do the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Illustrate data\n",
    "* Reduce complexity \n",
    "* Compare things\n",
    "* Raise awareness\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparing Data Visualization and Infographics\n",
    "\n",
    "Infographics are a particular type of data visualization, so they share a lot of overlap.  They both seek order, and are both meant to be informative. Further, they both can involve highly skilled people from a large number of disciplines, such as programmers, designers, statisticians, journalists, developers, geneticists, economists, and so forth. Both data visualization and infographics hopefully lead us to the still more refined state: Knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, data visualization can be created for the purposes of making sense of the data, or to change a data set into a more accessible form. Often data sets can be so massive and unwieldy that it can be almost impossible or laborious for a human to process. Therefore data visualizations are far more likely to be generated automatically through the use of algorithms or computer programs than infographics, which may use graphic design software. Infographics often contain summaries of the data, or look at things in aggregate (means, frequencies), while data visualizations are more likely to look at all the data in a chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because infographics typically do not include all the data, this means that they're more focused, which can be a boon.  But it also means that they are slightly more likely to inadvertently introduce bias by not presenting the whole picture.  This is not necessarily a bad thing; typically infographics are created for a specific purpose and are used for marketing or public awareness campaigns.  But it is something to be aware of as you peruse a wide variety of infographics.\n",

Instead, infographics are usually designed for a particular purpose. It may be to help with your company's marketing efforts, it may be to communicate findings to upper leadership, it may be to educate a population...whatever the reason, it is important to really hammer out why the infographic is being created.  Without a clear purpose, you are likely to spend a lot of work on something that doesn't get used much.  No one wants that!\n",

    "## Properties of Color\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two properties of color you should be familiar with - the *hue* and the *saturation* of a color.  Hue is what you think of right away when you think of colors - red, green, blue, etc.  Saturation is how light or dark that color is; it literally is defined as how much white you have mixed in with the paint, if you were an artist. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below you have a color wheel.  As you go around the perimeter of the wheel, that is your hue.  As you go from the middle of the wheel out, that is your saturation.  The closer to the edge you get, the more highly saturated your color is.\n",

    "## How Computers Process Color\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main system your computer uses to process colors - the *rgb* system or the *hex code* system. You can think of the rgb system like your print ink.  There are three base colors, a red-ish, a yellow-ish, and a blue-ish, and they can combine to make all the other colors.  The same is true in rgb.  Each color has it's own value from 0-255 that tells you how much of each color you are adding, with 0 being none, and 255 being all. A nice dusky pink, for instance, might be ```255, 153, 204```. These values go in order of the system rgb - so the 255 is for red, the 153 is for green, and the 204 is for blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hex code system uses a six-digit, hexadecimal number to represent color.  Again, there are three blocks of code for red, green, and blue, but instead of a number for each ranging from 0-255, there is now a number ranging from zero to FF. A hex code will always start with a #, and uses the format ```#RRGGBB```. The same dusky pink in hex code is #FF99CC.\n",
    "\n",
    "You won't need to generate these codes on your own, or even know what they mean just by looking at them, but knowing how color is represented on your computer will allow you greater control of color when you start creating your own infographics and will allow you to match colors if necessary. With over 16 million colors out there, getting back to \"that one you used before\" can be tricky unless you've saved the code or know how to access it!\n",

    "With color, the general rule of thumb is that you don't want any more than three colors or shades of the same color.  Any more than that, and you are distracting the eye and the reader will spend more time taking in your colors than your message! Generally, if you go with three colors, you want a main color, a secondary color, and a third color that is just used a little bit as an accent.  This third small accent color can be something bright and bold - you are using it sparingly, so it can be a little bit further out there.\n",

    "\n",
    "When you start putting together different colors, they form a color palette.  There are several ways that a color palette can be built.  The basic ones are shown below: \n",
    "\n",
    "![Four bars shaded in different colors are labeled monochromatic, analogous, complementary, and triad.](Media/infographic18.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "The third row demonstrates the *complementary* color palette.  If you follow a traditional color wheel, then complementary colors are on the exact opposite side of the color wheel from each other.  This can look a bit jarring at first, especially if you keep the saturation up really high, like the red and green colors all the way to the left.  But if you start to bring down the saturation, like the pair all the way on the right hand side, using a complementary color palette can really look keen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last row demonstrates the *triad* color palette.  No, you're not suddenly learning about the Chinese mafia here. The triad is when your three colors are evenly spaced out along your color wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're thinking to yourself that this is all a bit complicated, and that as a data scientist you're much more comfortable with numbers than colors, never fear! There are plenty of websites out there that provide you with ready-made color palettes you can utilize. **[Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create)** is one of the better ones, and even provides you with the basic color palette options! From there, it's up to you to move around the color wheel and pick something you find visually appealing.

This means that anyone who has a disability can still use and understand your work.  For websites and things, there are lots of laws about accessibility, but for infographics, the number one issue you need to be concerned with is those who are color-blind. There are two types of color blindness - red/green color blindness, in which the person can't differentiate between red and green, and blue/purple color blind, in which the person can't differentiate between blue and purple colors.

The remainder of this lesson is geared towards infographic creation in MS Power Point, a readily available and easy to use program with which most of you have some familiarity. If you're experienced in other graphic design software, such as Adobe Illustrator or it's free compatriot, Inkscape, or even MS Publisher, feel free to use them if you wish - but know that those are not necessary for the infographic design you will embark upon today.\n",

Shapes can be used to build basic graphics and for sectioning off the different pieces of your infographic and helping with flow.  Pictures, often used sparingly in infographics, can nevertheless be used on occasion as a focal point.  Text boxes mean that you can place text anywhere on your infographic, and can easily change their size, shape, color, and even the background and border of the area in which the text is placed. *Icons*, great simple pictures, are the backbone of any infographic, and the latest version of MS Power Point has a wide range of them that you can utilize. Don't worry, though - even if your version of MS Power Point does not include an icon feature, you will learn about the different sources of all kinds of imagery on the next page, including icons.\n",

Google has cleverly developed a button with just this problem in mind.  Click on the ```Tools``` button, then in the middle section where it says ```Usage rights```.  The most stringent, or rigorous, option here is ```Labeled for reuse with modification```.  This means you can reuse the graphic in any way you like! It can be for a business or for your own private use, and you can even change it if you see fit! After that is ```Labeled for reuse```.  This is the filter you most likely want to use if you are working for a company and don't intend to modify the image, since it will cover commercial use.  If you're doing something for personal demonstration, however, your options get a little broader - you can choose ```Labeled for noncommercial reuse with modification`` or ```Labeled for noncommercial reuse```, depending on what your needs are.  Typically, ```Labeled for reuse``` will cover most of your needs. You'll know you've activated a filter when the text for it turns blue and is shown in the toolbar. \n",

    "\n",
    "This first infographic is very busy! In addition, you have no focal point - the word \"libraries\" appears three times, so where do you look? Your eye skips right over the blue text at the top, so you land in the \"libraries libraries libraries\" section next. As you proceed down the page, the numbers are the focal point, not what those numbers represent, so you are left confused and unsatisfied. Lastly, the image in the middle on the very bottom shows a counter-intuitive depiction, with full smileys on the right, and full frownies on the left.  Typically in our culture, you would see this in reverse, so it has the potential to confuse people greatly.\n",

    "![A page displays a heading that reads, libraries are helping people to live healthier and happier lives and an icon for LOFE. The content describes that libraries provided people, reduced social isolation, 95-percent of participants strongly agreed that the project had increased their well being. The page also has three quoted texts that read, it has been the best thing I have done for my mental health and confidence, I have a reason to leave the house, and I'm more mindful to a few minutes of quiet to listen to my child playing. I don't need to control the situation, just enjoy the process with her.](Media/infographic9.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This second infographic is also very busy! Although the title does serve as a better focal point, it is too text heavy, and the images are too detailed and too big.  All of this detracts from the main message.  Further, the headers for the timeline are all over the place - some are vertical, some are horizontal, some go onto two lines, they all have different colors - and it's a good idea when comparing things to keep the format consistent. While the color scheme is overall good, it includes four colors: orange, grey, black, and white. It's not all bad news, though - one of the things this infographic did well is to establish a good flow about the page.\n",
