    "After you run an analysis your results may be momentous!  Earth-shattering! World-changing! But if you cannot communicate how important it is in a way everyone can clearly understand, it will mean nothing and you will be sent back to your dark little cubicle in defeat, feeling helpless in the knowledge that you have the key to the gates of Heaven and no one understands, crushed under the weight of the responsibility!  Therefore, learning how to communicate results is just as important as figuring out how to get them.  While Python and R do have built-in visualization capabilities, they are limited, time consuming, and complicated at best.  Here you will be introduced to software specifically designed for data visualization.  This is most definitely a software you should use, not only because it is handy, but because it is in-demand in the market place, and there are jobs that revolve completely around it. Convinced? It doesn’t matter! You will jump in anyways. \n",

    "In this lesson, you will learn how to create charts and tables in Tableau, a point-and-click data visualization program.  By the end of this lesson, you should be able to: \n",

    "* Load data into Tableau\n",
    "* Perform data joins and blends\n",
    "* Recognize the difference between measures and dimensions\n",

    "* Sort data\n",
    "* Create bar charts, stacked bar charts, line charts, dual axis charts, scatter plots, and tree maps\n",
    "* Add reference lines and colors\n",

    "First, you will see everything is broken down into *Dimensions* and *Measures*.  These are new names for old concepts.  Dimensions will be your Categorical Variables, and are thought of as ways to break up your data.  Measures are things that can be measured, and that will make them your Continuous Variables.  Tableau will automatically separate these, but will occasionally get one wrong.  You can manually change them by right clicking on them and selecting ```Convert to Dimension```, or ```Covert to Measure```.  \n",

You will see that even though ```ID``` is considered a number with ```#```, Tableau is smart enough to put it in as a Dimension, because it is not something you can add or subtract, but rather something that you can use to separate out your data.\n",

    "---\n",

    "## Data Aggregation\n",

    "Finally, Tableau will aggregate all measures.  By default, it will sum up the entire column into one big block. You can change how it is aggregated, by clicking the arrow on the side of it, selecting ```Measure(Sum)```, and selecting another option from the drop down menu.  However, no matter how you aggregate it, it will still just be one block.\n",
