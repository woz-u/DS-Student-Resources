Typically, the best way to go to be sure you get everything right and decrease confusion is to just rename them.  But there may be times when you forge ahead accidentally.  Rather than this being an “oh shoot” moment, R helps you out in your time of trouble by adding into the variable name which dataset the variable came from, as you can see here.  You ended up with two columns named ```scores_of_panel```, one in each dataset, and so R automatically added on ```.x``` or ```.y``` to inform you from which dataset that column originated.

    "# Merging Datasets in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "As with R, there are many different ways to combine data sets in Python.  The first is a simple merge.  After you have installed the ```pandas``` package, all you need to do is call ```pd.merge()``` function and specify your datasets. Python will do the rest! There isn’t even a need to specify a common variable between the sets like there is in R: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "IceSkating = pd.merge(judgesAspectsUnique, performances)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifying the Common Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "If you did feel the urge to specify the common variable, however, that is easily done with the ```on=``` argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "IceSkating = pd.merge(judgesAspectsUnique, performances, on='performance_id')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And if those keywords don’t match up – no need to sweat it! Python also is set up to use common fields with different names, by specifying ```left_on=``` and ```right_on=```: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "IceSkating = pd.merge(judgesAspectsUnique, performances, left_on='performance_id', right_on='id_performance)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Happens When Columns are Named the Same, but Contain Different Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, just like in R, Python can also handle overlapping column names that represent different things.  Although it is wise to try to catch these beforehand and rename as necessary, if you do overlook columns named the same thing in different datasets, Python will automatically add ```_x``` or ```_y``` to the column names to show from which dataset the data was derived.  As demonstrated below, when you have two columns named ```scores_of_panel```, Python will give you a hand: \n",
    "\n",
    "![A table has ten columns with two-row entries. The column headings are labeled scores of panel x, competition, program, name, nation, rank, starting number, total segment score, total element score, and scores of panel y.](Media/104.L1.30.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifying the Type of Join\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to specify the types of joins you want, unlike R.  If you wanted to do an inner join, which would only select what’s in common between data sets, use the ```how=``` argument, and specify ```inner```. For outer joins, which will select everything, and place as missing (NaN) in Python anything that doesn’t overlap, you’ll specify ```outer```. You can also specify ```how=left``` or ```how=right```.  Here is what all four of those would look like: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "IceSkating = pd.merge(judgesAspectsUnique, performances, how='inner')\n",
    "IceSkating = pd.merge(judgesAspectsUnique, performances, how='outer')\n",
    "IceSkating = pd.merge(judgesAspectsUnique, performances, how='left')\n",
