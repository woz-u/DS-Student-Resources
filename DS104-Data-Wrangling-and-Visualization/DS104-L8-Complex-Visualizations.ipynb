The data shown on dashboards often indicate the health of a particular company, program, or initiative and can include data that measures outcomes as well as data that measures throughput, though throughput metrics are often more common. For this reason, dashboards often follow a red/amber/green color scheme to indicate status, with red being \"in trouble\" amber being \"potentially problematic\" and green being \"hunky dory.\" Managers like dashboards, because they can get a general feel of what is going on with the business at a glance.\n",

But when researchers scrutinized the data a bit more, they found that there was actually some bias in favor of women! Something called *Simpson's paradox* was at play here. Simpson's Paradox occurs when the observed phenomena is different from the explained phenomena after a lurking explanatory variable is taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Cal-Berkeley, the overall fact was true: more men (as a percentage of applicants) were accepted to grad school than women. In this case, the lurking variable is the programs to which these men and women applied. It turns out that more men applied to graduate programs in science, whereas more women applied to graduate programs in the humanities. The sciences require special technical skills, but they accepted a large percentage of applicants. On the other hand, the humanities only required a standard undergrad curriculum, but they also had fewer slots. When the department to which they applied was accounted for, department by department the women's acceptance rates are actually higher overall than the men's acceptance rates. The difference was small, but real.\n",

    "Dr. Hans Rosling was a Swedish physician and professor of international health. Dr. Rosling used a rare combination of charisma, knowledge, data visualization, dynamic charts, and interesting subject matter to become one of the world's greatest communicators. He pioneered a group called Gapminder, which brings the ability to create really cool data visualizations to everyone.\n",

    "\n",
    "Dr. Rosling did many presentations similar to this one. He believed there is a lot of misconception out there in the world regarding mortality, health, and wealth. He tries to clear up a lot of the misconceptions, but he seems to do it in such a way without an agenda. He touches on a lot of topics that are hot buttons with many, and are politicized all over the world in order for some to try and advance their agenda.\n",

    "The purpose for having you watch this video is two-fold:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, you should get a sense of the potential dynamic charts have to communicate ideas clearly and succinctly, much better than a series of static charts would have.\n",
    "* Second, you should get a feel of how important it is to let data do the talking. Dr Rosling is making observations and predictions based on data, and not on opinion.\n",

The bar for Feb 2014 crosses 1200 on the y-axis.](Media/L09-01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a clever use of inputs from the user. This chart is dynamic in that it allows a user to change the entry in cell N1, and determine how many months worth of data they want to include in the graph. Changing the entry in cell N1 to 3 (for example) will modify the amount of the table in columns A and B that are included in the graph. It also modifies a cell (not shown, off to the right of the shown portion) from which the graph title is taken. If cell N1 is changed to 3, then the graph label will read ```Sales for the last **3** Months```.\n",

The graph is set up to show one article of clothing at a time, selected using the radio buttons at the bottom of the graph. Again, this is a clever trick where the creator of the graph has set up a dummy table which is out of view. When the user selects one of the radio buttons, the dummy table is modified so that the two 'not selected' columns from the original data table are filled with N/A's. This modifies the graph so that only the selected curve is shown.\n",

This is another clever little trick that uses the scroll bar to determine how many rows of the 'Sales' column appear on the table at the left.\n",

    "One note on this graph - Is it practical? Can you think of a situation where you would only want to show a portion of the available data starting from the left?
