The ANOVA family of analyses are endlessly diverse, which make them a great tool to have in your pocket! You can have as many independent variables as you like, as long as you have the sample size for it, and you can add it covariates that will help control for factors that may influence how your IV and your DV are related.\n",

Therefore, this lesson you will dig into within subjects ANOVAs, which help you look at changes over time, mixed-measures ANOVAs, which have both a within and between subjects element to them, and ANCOVAs, which stands for *Analysis of Covariance*, and will include one or more covariates.\n",

    "*ANCOVA* stands for *analysis of covariance*.  It is an analysis in the family of ANOVAs, and the big difference is that \"C.\" An ANCOVA takes into account, or adjusts for, yet another factor in your model, aptly named a *covariate*.  Put another way, an ANCOVA controls for the changes that might come up naturally.  For instance, men are slightly better than women at spatial and analytic reasoning on average.  If you were trying to test out a new method of studying for a math class, and you tested it on both men and women, you would want to make sure to control for the natural effect that gender might have in mathematical reasoning. You could test the spatial and analytic reasoning skills at pre-test, teach everyone to study with your new method, and then test spatial and analytic reasoning skills at post-test.  If you collected information from everyone about their gender, you could then use it to control for the natural differences between men and women, using it as a covariate.\n",

The ```car``` library is both for assessing homogeneity of variance and for dealing with violations of said assumption.

However, one assumption is added - the assumption of *homogeneity of regression slopes*, which tests for whether the predictor variable (DV) and the covariate are independent of each other. This is because you are controlling for the presence of the covariate, not determining whether it has an effect on your DV. If the covariate is related in any way to your DV, then most likely it should be an independent variable, not a covariate, because it is explaining some variance in your model.\n",

    "The ```lm()``` function specifies that this is a linear model.  Then you'll input your y variable, or DV, first. In this case, since you are predicting a student's chance of admission into graduate school, your DV is ```Chance.of.Admit```.  What follows immediately after the tilde is a mash-up of things. There are a couple important things to note: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The covariate(s) ALWAYS has to come first!! This is because the variables are taken in order in this case, and you want the effects of the covariate to be parsed out first.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The plus sign adds in additional covariates or independent variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The asterisk creates what is called an *interaction term*.  It looks at the effects of one thing BY another thing. Sometimes, you will find effects when looking at an interaction term that were invisible even if you had both variables together in the model, so it's typically a best practice to always include an interaction term if you are going to have more than one IV or CV in your model (basically, anything that is not a one-way ANOVA).\n",

    "\n",
    "If you failed the assumption of homogeneity of variance, not to fear! There is a quick and easy additional line you can add to the base model.  Instead of running the ```anova()``` function, you can instead run the ```Anova()``` function.  Catch the difference there? The function that corrects for a violation of homogeneity of variance has a capital \"A,\" whereas the \"regular\" summary function doesn't.  If it helps, think of the big \"A\" as standing for \"assumption,\" so when you've violated the assumption, head for that!\n",

The ```Type=``` argument refers to how the ANOVA is calculated, in terms of its sum of squares (noted as ```Sum Sq``` in your R output).  Whenever you have an interaction effect, you will always want ```Type=\"I\"```, but here are all the types and what they are used for. To be honest, if you have a pretty basic and well-balanced design (relatively equal sample sizes in each of the groups), then it doesn't matter which one you select typically.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Type II:** This type of ANOVA examines the effects of all the main effects, but ignores any interaction effects.  So it is not suitable if you have more than one IV or CV in your model and want to determine how they interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Type III:** This is used only when you want to look at only some sums of squares effects. Basically, you can examine only the effects you specify by changing the options for contrasts. You can think of *contrasts* as built-in, planned post hocs.  Specifying them in advance and being specific as to what you are looking for means that you have less Type I error, but they can be a pain to use.  Hence they will not be covered in this course!\n",
