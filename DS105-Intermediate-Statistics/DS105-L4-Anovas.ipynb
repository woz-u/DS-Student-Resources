    "# What is an ANOVA?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVAs are wonderful! You will quickly fall in love with them! They are versatile, robust, and relatively simple to understand and conduct.  ANOVAs are where your true intermediate statistics journey begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of an ANOVA as a *t*-test on steroids.  Depending on the type of ANOVA, it can either replace your independent *t* test, your dependent *t* test, or it can even handle BOTH scenarios at once.  Is your mind blown yet? Ready to convert to ANOVAs for life? \n",
    "\n",
    "You will use an ANOVA to compare the means of the different levels of an independent variable(s). The independent variable will be a categorical variable.  Unlike your independent *t*-test, which can only handle two levels of the independent variable, or two groups at a time, the ANOVA can handle more than two levels of your independent variable.  The dependent variable will remain continuous, and there is still only one.  So, if you have a theoretical example in which you want to determine whether color affects the fluffiness of a dog's coat, in a *t*-test, you could only compare two different coat colors at a time.  Maybe black and white.  But with an ANOVA, you can look at more than two levels of the independent variable, so you can compare more coat colors at a time - maybe black, white, apricot, and brown.  In this scenario, the coat color is the independent variable, also sometimes called the grouping variable, because it is made up of groups, and the dependent variable is a continuous measure of coat fluffiness, for each dog you have in your sample.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the concept behind the ANOVA is that you are seeing if the variance in the dependent variable is in any way related to the grouping of the independent variable. Is there a pattern, in which certain groups have higher or lower means? \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types of ANOVAs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different types of ANOVAs: between subjects and within subjects ANOVAs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Between Subjects ANOVAs\n",
    "\n",
    "*Between Subjects ANOVAs* fall in the same class as independent *t*-tests and independent Chi-Squares.  All of these analyses look for differences between two separate, or independent, groups.  There is no overlap between one group and the next.  It is called a between subjects ANOVA because you are looking at mean difference between people, often called subjects in a research study.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"panel panel-info\">\n",
    "    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n",
    "        <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Tip!</h3>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n",
    "        <p>Sometimes in the biological fields, this is called a Type I ANOVA instead of a between subjects ANOVA. </p>\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Within Subjects ANOVAs\n",
    "\n",
    "*Within Subjects ANOVAs* fall in the same class as dependent *t*-tests.  They are used when you have paired data or related samples.  Most often, this is done by looking at change over time.  However, a dependent *t*-test can only handle a pre- and post-test design, whereas, since ANOVAs can have multiple levels, they can handle additional timepoints.  Anything from \"beginning, middle, end\" designs to looking at time bins for time periods can be done with an ANOVA.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Within subjects ANOVAs get their name because you are looking at the same person, or research subject, over and over again.  Because within subjects ANOVAs are so often used to look at things over time, they are often called *repeated measures ANOVAs* as well. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Number of Independent Variables \n",
    "\n",
    "With both between and within subjects ANOVAs, you can also add a clarifier on that deals with the number of independent variables.  So there are also one-way and factorial ANOVAs, which can be either between or within subjects. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### One-Way ANOVAs\n",
    "\n",
    "When an ANOVA has only one independent variable, regardless of the number of levels, than this is called a *one-way ANOVA*. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factorial ANOVAs \n",
    "\n",
    "When there is more than one independent variable, than as a whole, it is a *factorial ANOVA*.  However, ANOVAs are typically named by the number of independent variables they contain, so if you had two independent variables, it would be called a *two-way ANOVA*, and if you had three independent variables, it would be called a *three-way ANOVA*, etc.  Although there is no limit to the number of independent variables you can have in an ANOVA, as long as you have enough data, practically going above a three or four way ANOVA becomes very difficult to interpret, so it is not recommended. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mixed Measures ANOVAs \n",
    "\n",
    "In a factorial ANOVA, where there are multiple variables, you can mix and match your variables, so that there is one or more between subjects variables as well as a within subject variable.  This is called a *mixed measures* or *mixed design* ANOVA.  \n",

    "# Assumptions for ANOVAs\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like any statistical test, there are assumptions for ANOVAs that you need to meet in order for them to be the most effective and the least biased.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Normality\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumption should be very familiar to you! Just like most statistics, ANOVAs require your data to be normally distributed, or distributed as close to normal as possible.  If your data are not normal, they will need to be transformed to approximate the normal distribution. Luckily, the ANOVA is relatively robust, so especially as your sample size increases, and if you keep your group sizes relatively equal, it can handle some deviations from normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Homogeneity of Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "On the simplest level, *homogeneity of variance* means the variance, or the spread of data, is equal.  The root *homo* means same, so think of homogeneity as \"same variance.\" In the context of an ANOVA assumption, it means that the variance of one variable should not affect the variance of another variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's probably easier to look at an illustration: \n",
    "\n",
    "![A graph depicts the comparison of GPR, Kernel Ridge, and SVR. The x-axis represents data and the y-axis represents target. There are four curves plotted to represent true, SVR, KRR, and GPR. Plotted points represent the data.](Media/ANOVA1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "See how the means change some along the x axis, from the first curve to the second curve, but that the actual spread of the data is relatively the same? The distance between the highest and the lowest dot on the first curve is approximately the same as the distance between the highest and lowest dot on the second curve, but the actual placement of those dots is relative to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "If some of these curves had a really wide spread of data, or a really small spread, then that wouldn't be equal variance.  Instead, the variance would be unequal, which is also called *heterogeneity of variance*. The root word *hetero* means difference, so you can think of heterogeneity as \"difference variance.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Size\n",
    "\n",
    "You must have an adequate sample size in order for ANOVAs to effectively test for differences between groups. Typically, a higher sample size is required the more complex your analysis is, and ANOVAs are no exception.  You must have a least 20 cases per independent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Independence \n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption of independence means that your groups must be unrelated, or independent, of each other (except for within subjects designs). You could theoretically test this by correlating each level of your independent variables with each other, but it's typically not done.  Really, meeting the assumption of independence is just more about how you are setting up your \"experiment\" or choosing your data to analyze.  Make sure that there is no overlap between your groups and that the levels you are testing are not related in some way, like having the same people.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't meet the assumption of independence, you are much more likely to commit Type I error, saying something is significant when it's really not. And there's no way to correct for this assumption - it's better just to not run an ANOVA if you feel you have violated the assumption of independence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sphericity (for Between Subjects Designs Only)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sphericity is a lot like homogeneity of variance, but applies specifically to repeated measures or between subjects designs.  Say, for instance, you are measuring the activity level of dogs in their first year, second year, third year, and fourth year.  If there is sphericity, then the association between each set of years should be approximately the same: 1 - 2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, and 2-4. However, when you're dealing with changes over time, it is often likely that things that happen closer together in time are more closely associated with each other.  As your dog ages, you would expect that he or she would become a little less energetic.  So the correlation between year 1 and year 2 activity rates is probably much higher than the correlation between the year 1 and year 4 activity rates, for instance.  When sphericity is present in a between subjects design, there are many ways in which you can correct for it.  \n",

But with an ANOVA, you can't just look at the means right away, because the *F* and associated *p* value just let you know that there is a difference between at least set of the three categories.  In your example, the mean prices could be different between the beauty and food and drink category, the beauty and photography category, the food and drink and photography category, or some combination of those three! \n",

    "That's where *post hocs* come in.  They are specifically designed to test all the pairs between your data, which is why they are also often known as *pairwise comparisons*. This is done with *t*-tests.  But the inherent problem with using multiple *t*-tests is that the more analyses you run, the more you increase your chances of Type I error. So you're more likely to find something significant when it really isn't. So, typically a post hoc will apply a correction, or adjustment, so that the *t*-tests become more stringent, and you are therefore correcting for doing multiple *t*-tests by applying stricter criteria.  That way your Type I error doesn't run rampant! \n",
