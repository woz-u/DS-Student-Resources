    "# MapReduce\n",
    "\n",
    "_MapReduce_ is what's known as a programming model that is used to process large amounts data across multiple computers in two steps: _map_ and _reduce_. The concept of MapReduce is to take a collection of data, such as the `crimes-sample.csv` file, _map_ (or filter) the desired data to produce a list of results in a key-value pair format, then those key-value pairs are sent to the _reduce_ step, which aggregates the results. The mapper helps optimize your work as well - you will basically throw away any data you aren't currently interested in, and then extract and organize the things that you do care about so that it can be aggregated.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"panel panel-success\">\n",
    "    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n",
    "        <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Fun Fact!</h3>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n",
    "        <p>MapReduce was the result of two Google researchers in 2004 who wrote a research paper titled <a href=\"https://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html\">\"MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters.\"</a></p>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is best understood by visualizing what's happening with real data and code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How MapReduce Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are handed the task of writing a Python program, using the `crimes-samples.csv` file as data, to count how many crime reports resulted in an arrest and how many did _not_ result in an arrest. Since MapReduce is a two step process, the work will be split into two parts. The _map_ step will process the \"Arrest\" column in the `crimes-samples.csv` file and produce a list as shown below, where \"Yes\" means an arrest occurred and \"No\" means there was not an arrest. The comma followed by the number one in the output below is used to count each instance and will make more sense in the reduce step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example `Map` Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some example map results: \n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Yes,1\n",
    "No,1\n",
    "No,1\n",
    "Yes,1\n",
    "No,1\n",
    "No,1\n",
    "No,1\n",
    "Yes,1\n",
    "Yes,1\n",
    "No,1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, MapReduce is primarily used when data processing will be distributed to multiple computers. Therefore, imagine multiple computers process their own different crime files and produce a list of results similar to the one above. Once the _map_ step is done, the next step is to _reduce_ or aggregate all of these entries into a simpler representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example `Reduce` Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some example reduce results:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Yes,4\n",
    "No,6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, the values ```Yes``` and ```No``` are treated like keys in a dictionary with the value 1 being treated as the value. During the _reduce_ step, each line is processed and the values for each key are combined. So there were four entries that were a \"Yes\" and six entries that were a \"No\" that came out of the map step, which were added together in this reduce step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## MapReduce Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps that take place under the hood when you run a MapReduce program on a Hadoop cluster:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You (the client node) send in your code\n",
    "* YARN keeps track of what machines need to be utilized and copies data to HDFS or other distributed filing system as needed\n",
    "* MapReduce Application master runs under a NodeManager and keeps track of all the nodes that are working to complete the MapReduce task\n",
    "* The task takes place while talking to HDFS\n",
    "\n",
    "The system tries to ensure that your mapper gets run as close to where the data is located as possible, so that efficiency is increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Languages for MapReduce\n",
    "\n",
    "While Hadoop was programmed in Java, you can utilize the concept of MapReduce through Python as well as many other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How MapReduce Handles Failure\n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce can be quite slow, and isn't used as a standalone often anymore for that reason, but it does handle failure at a wide variety of levels pretty well - it is resilient.  Below, you will find a table of potential things that could go wrong and how MapReduce will handle the situation: \n",

It is interactive and scalable, allowing you to use it on an entire cluster of computers, no matter how many you have.  It's also pretty flexible, so you can use Hive to connect to other types of databases and write your own *user-defined functions* if you'd like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hive does have a few limitations, however.  It does take a few minutes to execute queries, and it is limited compared to other programs you'll learn later, such as Pig and Spark.  It also does not allow you to perform CRUD operations because Hive does not connect to a real-time database.\n",

    "## HiveQL vs. SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Most things really are the same between HiveQL and SQL.  However, HiveQL uses views slightly differently than SQL. In SQL, when you create a view, it stores the data as a temporary table that you can access later.  With HiveQL, the view is just a construct, not data actually stored anywhere.  The purpose of the view in HiveQL is to enable you to break up complicated queries into smaller individual ones.\n",

This is done to speed up processing; it would be clunky and slow if you had to maintain a data structure (think tables) all the time. The opposition to schema on read is *schema on write*; this represents a traditional SQL table system.\n",

You can even count the number of book ids you have by wrapping the column ```bookid``` in the ```count``` function, and give it a name, too: ```ratingCount```.  Then make sure you tell Hive where these columns are coming from, using that trusty ```from``` statement.
