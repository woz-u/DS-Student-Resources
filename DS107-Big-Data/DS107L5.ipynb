    "# Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "*Spark* is a data processing program built on top of MapReduce in the Hadoop ecosystem.  Among many, many other things, it allows you to perform machine learning, data mining, and data streaming. It is powerful, fast, and scalable.  How fast, you ask? 100 times faster than MapReduce, which is why MapReduce has pretty much become obsolete as an actual tool, though it remains an incredibly important and foundational big data concept. It uses the same kind of framework as TEZ to work backwards and find the fastest solution to your queries.  Spark is actually written in *Scala*, but you can code in Spark using Python, Scala, or Java, with Python and Scala being the most popular languages. When using Spark, there are a lot of similarities between Python and Scala.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spark Components \n",
    "\n",
    "Spark has come a long way in the last several years, and now has a lot of different components that you can utilize within Spark to get varying data science tasks completed.  These components include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Spark Core:** This is the base program for Spark.   It is also known as *Spark 1.0*. \n",
    "* **Spark Streaming:** Allows you to feed in real-time data and provide real-time output. \n",
    "* **Spark SQL:** Write SQL queries and use SQLite functions in Spark. This is part of *Spark 2.0.* \n",
    "* **MLLib:** A library of machine learning and data mining tools you can use in Spark. This is also part of *Spark 2.0*.\n",
    "* **GraphX:** Allows you to create social network graphs and determine the degrees of separation in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these Spark components, you will be introduced to all but GraphX, which is quite specialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Programming Steps in Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you will be using Spark to do all kinds of big data work, there are a few general steps that you will most likely always take when working in Spark:\n",
    "\n",

With Spark SQL, you have the ability to read and write to a variety of file types, including JSON, Hive, and Parquet, and you can communicate with database connectors and with Tableau. \n",

    "## Reading in Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you will do is read in your data. For learning Spark 2.0 and Spark SQL, you will be looking at **[data with movie ratings](https://repo.exeterlms.com/documents/V2/DataScience/Big-Data/u.data.zip)**.  There is also a file that has the **[movie names](https://repo.exeterlms.com/documents/V2/DataScience/Big-Data/u.item.zip)** contained in it. Make sure you upload these files to the `files` view, which will allow you to follow along with the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll start by creating a line that identifies the structure that your data will have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "final case class Table(movieID: Int, rating: Int)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`Table` is just the name you will give to your data; it could be anything you like.  Within the parentheses, you have key-value pairs that represents the header and data type of each column.  In this case, the data only has two rows, so that keeps it nice and simple! Further, both are integers (`Int`), making this even easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you will need to transform your file into an RDD, by mapping.  In Scala, you will always start this with `val`.  Next, you'll give your RDD a name; in this case, `MappedTable`.  Then you will call `sc` for `Spark Context`, which just tells Zeppelin you are using Spark, and use the `textFile.map` command to map a flat text file into a usable RDD. You will put the file pathway in for the data.  Since you uploaded it earlier to your `maria_dev` section of your `Files View` in Ambari, the pathway below should work for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, call the `map` function.  Here, you are basically separating your data into columns. `x =>` basically tells it that you are going to define the way to split things next, and in the curly brackets `{}`, you will find that map of how to split, based on `val fields`.  This uses the `.split` function to break at the delimiter specified in the parentheses - in this case, tab: `\\t`. You could also split by other things, including, but not limited to, commas.  Then, you will call the `Table` structure you created earlier, and map each field to the appropriate data structure. Each field will be numbered in parentheses (i.e.`fields(1)`), and should be followed by `.to` the data type.  Since these were both `Int`, they are going to `Int`. The data type you specified above for `Table` must match what you call here.\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val MappedTable = sc.textFile(\"hdfs:///user/maria_dev/u.data\").map(x => {val fields = x.split(\"\\t\"); Table(fields(1).toInt, fields(2).toInt)})\n",

    "The decision tree was fun, and it was decently accurate.  But why stop there? Don't you want to be the best you possibly can? Well, you can probably improve things by playing with the *hyperparameters*. Hyperparameters are the components of the way your model has been created, and by changing them, you can get a better model fit. A decision tree has the following hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Maximum depth:** Limits the number of decisions you can make in a decision tree.  Sometimes having too many can lead to overfitting of data.\n",
    "* **Maximum bins:** Limits the number of decision rules the decision tree can have. A lot will probably make your decision tree more accurate, but could take up too much processing power.\n",
    "* **Impurity measure:** *Purity* is how good you are at classifying accurately.  If you have two categories, and each group only contains the appropriate data for that category, then you have complete purity.  If you have some mix-up in there, then you have *impurity*. You want to have low impurity.\n",
    "* **Minimum information gain:** If you include a decision rule that does not make the data more pure, then what good is it? Including a hyperparameter of minimum information gain allows you to only keep levels that will actually add to the accuracy of your data, and it can help ensure you don't overfit the model.\n",

The code below will create a *pipeline* for your decision tree data, and then the next set of code after that will be for trying all different varieties of these hyperparameters, to see which fits the best.  A pipeline is when you chain two operations together, so that you don't need to keep running them individually over and over again. Using something like this can take some time and processing power on the computer's end, but will save you the trouble of having to tune everything manually, one at a time, which would take forever!\n",
