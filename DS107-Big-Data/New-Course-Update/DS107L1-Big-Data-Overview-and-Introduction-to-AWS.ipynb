    "# What is Big Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is usually categorized as \"big\" when you can no longer process it efficiently on one computer.  However, the parameters for this will differ by both dataset and computer setup.  There is no one cutoff that allows someone to say \"my data is big;\" there is no set number of columns or rows that will push you over the edge into \"big data\" territory.  You could have a relatively small number of records (rows), but have a lot of columns.  You could have data that are images, audio, or text that is space and processing intensive.  You could have a relatively small set of variables in key-pair format that is updated incredibly frequently.  All of these may or may not be instances of big data, based on their particular ramifications AND based on the computer you're using.  A ten year old system running an Intel i5 processor is going to be able to handle much less data than a brand-new computer with a solid state hard drive and an Intel i9 or Mac M1 Max processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "If ACME Groceries has collected both the dates and times of each item sold in their store, they're empowered to ask questions concerning inventory. This sounds simple, right? The variables you're interested in are only date, time, and item.  How can that possibly become big data? Well, think about how many items a store has.  Think about how many customers PER DAY they may receive.  Think about how many items at a time a customer may purchase.  Think about how many years back you may want to conduct your analysis. Is it starting to look a lot bigger now? What if you wanted just a little more information, and you increased data collection to include multiple ACME Groceries in the chain? Now maybe you need store location as well, and you have increased the number of dates, times, and items tenfold. The amount of data generated and stored becomes monumental! \n",
    "\n",
    "With fine detail and vast records of customer purchase history, companies can spot patterns and predict customer behavior. Big data makes large-scale insights possible. For instance, consider the following questions that can be answered with just those few variables and the actions that can be taken with those answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What month has the highest produce sales?\n",
    "\n",
    "  **_Action:_** Mail out advertisements and coupons the week prior to additionally incentivize produce purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which two items are frequently purchased together?\n",
    "\n",
    "  **_Action:_** Place these items adjacent to each other to enhance the likelihood they will both be purchased.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the five most frequently purchased items between the hours of 6:00 AM and 8:00 AM?\n",
    "\n",
    "  **_Action:_** Place the items in a popup kiosk near the front of the store for quick access in the morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which brand of toothpaste generates the most money?\n",
    "\n",
    "  **_Action:_** Move the best seller to the middle shelf (eye-level) to encourage purchases.\n",

    "## Properties of Big Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The properties of big data are all denoted with a V. There are the main 3 Vs of Big Data, which are _Volume_, _Variety_, and _Velocity_.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Volume** refers to the size of the datasets being stored. According to an **[article](https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/)** by Statista, the total amount of data in the world is projected to rise steeply to 79 zetabytes by 2021. For those who are unfamiliar with the **[metric prefixes](https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/metric-si-prefixes)**, 79 zetabytes expanded is 79,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes! \n",

    "    <div class=\"panel panel-success\">\n",
    "        <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n",
    "            <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Additional Info!</h3>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "        <div class=\"panel-body\">\n",
    "            <p>To really get a perspective on how much data volume has changed, think about this: NASA traveled to the moon and back on only 4kb of memory! For more details about the early Apollo computing system, <a href=\"https://www.metroweekly.com/2014/07/to-the-moon-and-back-on-4kb-of-memory/\"> check this article out! </a></p>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Variety** refers to the different forms the data can take, such as images, video, audio, and text. These types of data often take more space to store and require longer processing times as well. Some systems will have a lot of variety, but others may be a little less dispersed. For example, Twitter's _variety_ dimension may consist mostly of text while YouTube's _variety_ dimension is primarily video.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Velocity** refers to the speed of data generation and storage. This typically ties into the \"real-time\" rate of data transmission.  With large-scale or global companies that are dealing with transactional or monitoring data, the velocity can be incredibly fast.  For instance, **[at the end of 2021 there were a half a billion Tweets being sent per day](https://startupbonsai.com/twitter-statistics/)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, as big data has gotten more popular, other Vs have been added.  Consider also noting: \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Veracity:** How trustworthy the data is. As data is coming in, is it likely to create discrepancies on your cluster? Are you likely to have duplicate records? What happens in the case of computer failure?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Value:** It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing! Big data has got to provide useful information and insights from it, otherwise, why are you throwing all this computer processing power and storage at it?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Vs can continue: read [The 42 V’s of Big Data and Data Science](https://www.elderresearch.com/blog/the-42-vs-of-big-data-and-data-science/) for imaginative and further reading. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Big Data Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental part of big data analysis is being able to process all of the necessary data, and because of the nature of big data, you're going to need more than one computer, elsewise the the processing time and cost is too much to justify the usefulness of the data. What if the work could be shared among two computers? Well, that would cut the time in half. What if a third computer were added? As you may guess, the more computers that are added, the shorter the amount of time required to process the same amount of data. This is called *scalability* - the ability to keep throwing additional computers at the data in a linear fashion - the more data you have, the more computers you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're harnessing multiple computers to do one job, altogether those computers are referred to as a *cluster*. Each individual computer in a cluster is referred to as a *node* typically, and you will have one main node that is running the whole enchilada, and then others that are just doing the work.  The node that is in charge is called the *manager node* and the computers that are working are the *worker nodes*.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that your workplace may or may not actually physically own the computers in the cluster. There are many services out there that allow you to rent out clusters.  This then becomes an endeavor in *virtual machines* as well.  For instance, depending on the processing needs of your data, you may be renting anywhere from a small partition on just one of the small silver boxes below to several silver boxes (each a computer). \n",
