Maybe you lost tons of time having to communicate about every little detail or having to work in lockstep, doing all the work together. Whatever the exact situation...wouldn't it be nice to avoid that whole rigamarole? Well guess what - you can! *Git* is a program for version control, and it's purpose is many fold. Git can help you:\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the most significant problems in working with a team is coordinating changes made by multiple members of a team. As a result, almost all projects use some form of *source control management (SCM)* system. This program is responsible for coordinating the changes made by multiple people within a project so that information is not lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular SCM systems is *Git*. Git is used extensively throughout the software industry, and is now often being used with data science as well. You will need to use Git to share files with your team mates and to post the final project so that potential employers can see your portfolio, so getting familiar with Git now is a great idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are many, many ways to interact with Git, including through the command line, you are going to be using two components. The first is *GitHub*, which is a website that houses all of your work and allows you to share your project with the world. The second is *GitKraken*, which is a GUI that allows you to perform the actual work of file sharing. You will need both in this lesson, but it all starts with GitHub. Please take the time now to create and register for your **<a href=\"https://github.com\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub account</a>**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "To start learning Git, you will need a *repository*. A repository, or repo for short, is a shared area where your files for a particular project live. On your GitHub home page, there is a button to create a repository. You can basically think of this as creating a new project. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Create repo button](Media/github-create-button.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Give the repo a name, and leave it public. \n",

    "    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n",
    "        <p>GitKraken, the software you'll be using with GitHub, is only free if you make your repository public. So even if you're a little nervous about having your work out there in the world, you'll need the public setting to follow along with the lessons </p>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, check the box that says `Initialize this repository with a README`. A *readme* is a file that contains information about the repository and project, and is ideally read first before going through any of the other work in the repo - hence the name \"read me.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Checking this box will add an initial commit, or change, to the repo. In this case, the commit is a file named `readme`. A *commit* is a snapshot of a collection of files at a point in time. Making a commit, or changing the contents of a file, does not influence the work that has been done before. Each commit, or change point, is saved along the way. Think of saving a word document on your computer. Every time you press the little floppy disc icon to save the file, it's writing over the previous one. But what if you could preserve the point in time when you pressed the save button, every single time? That is the essence and magic of Git - it does exactly that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although a repo can technically be empty, many tools do not handle this situation well, so it is generally a good idea to start off with an initial commit."

There are many graphical clients, but the visualization of repos in GitKraken makes it ideally suited for learning how various Git operations effect repos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead and download GitKraken here: **<a href=\"https://gitkraken.com\" target=\"_blank\">GitKraken Download</a>**\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to register, but you can use your GitHub account information you created earlier. This will connect GitKraken to your GitHub account, which will make interacting with GitHub much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done, go ahead and open up the GitKraken program on your computer. You should not be in your web browser anymore. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cloning your Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of copying the contents of a repo from one location to another is called *cloning*. When you clone a repo, you get a full copy of it on your computer. You can clone from one directory to another or across different computers; to Git it's all the same. However, most of the time you will clone from GitHub to your local computer, using GitKraken.\n",
    "\n",
    "With GitKraken open, first click on `File` and then `Clone Repo`: \n",
    "\n",
    "![Cloning in GitKraken](Media/Clone1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This should bring you to a menu like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Cloning in GitKraken](Media/Clone2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to clone from `GitHub.com` and `Where to clone to` is the location you want the repository to live on your computer. You should be able to select the repository you created on GitHub easily in the `Repository to clone` section. Once you have selected a repository to clone, you will see that the `Clone the repo!` button turns green. Go ahead and push it! Who doesn't want to push buttons? \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see a box in the far left corner of GitKraken pop up to show your progress in cloning. Since you started a new repository, and it's basically empty, this window shouldn't flash for more than a few seconds. If you're cloning an existing repository when being added to a project, this step can take longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is done when you see a banner along the top of GitKraken, telling you that you have `Successfully cloned repo`. Go ahead and click that green `Open Now` button so you can learn and explore. "

    "\n",
    "When you have multiple commits in a repo, keeping track of where you want to make new commits can be confusing. Git solves this with something called a *branch*. Branches are named labels that point to a particular commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you make a new commit, you do so on one of the branches. By default, there is a `master` branch, as you have so far utilized, but you can make up any branches that you like. When the new commit is made, the current branch is automatically updated to point at the new commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you won't really need to make use of branches in order to work with a final project team, it's a good thing to learn about them, in case your new workplace uses them. A particularly common Git workflow is to create a new branch for each feature, or large section, that is added to a project. This new branch allows you to keep track of the changes made for the new feature without impacting the main branch that other data scientists are using to make small modifications and bug fixes. You'll need to understand how to switch branches to make edits and then merge those edits back into a \"mainline\" or \"trunk\" branch. The main branch is usually named `master` as the default.\n",

    "You should not be hesitant to make a new branch when it is helpful. To accomplish this, right-click on any commit and select `Create branch here`. You can create a branch at any commit.  In the example below, the branch named `dev` is added at the initial commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "![New branch](Media/gk-two-branches.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the current branch, `dev` is already at the initial commit in the working directory, the `README.md` file will have its original contents, and the `newFile.txt` will not exist. Those changes are safely recorded in the commit that `master` points towards, but the current working directory reflects whatever the currently checked out branch is, in this case, `dev`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can experiment with this.  Open your file browser to the directory where your repo is located and look at the files. Switch branches and you will see the contents change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Switch back to the `dev` branch and make some changes to the `README.md`. This time, instead of changing the existing line, add a new line. Once that is done, commit the changes.\n",

    "Great! You have some new work done on an independent branch. If you were working in a team, this might be work you are putting into a new project that is not yet ready to be run by everyone. At some point though, you are going to want to share what you have done with the rest of the team. This is done by merging your branch into the main working branch of your project. In your case, you will merge `dev` into `master`. You can do this by dragging `dev` onto `master` and choosing `merge dev into master`. When you do this, you will get a message about needing to switch branches. In Git, you must be on the branch that it is being merged into, so you need to check out `master` first.\n",

    "\n",
    "To resolve this, you will need to include the first line from `master` and the second line from `dev`. To accomplish this, first select the box in the `master` column, this will add the first line to the output window. Next, you need to select just the second line from `dev` which can be accomplished by hovering over that line and clicking the green plus icon.\n",
