What if you can't just drag and drop it in? There are *streaming* technologies that interface with Hadoop to automatically bring in data from its source. These sources can be anything, but to give you some examples, you could have data streaming into Hadoop from web server logs, stock market transactions, or sensors from the *internet of things (IOT)*. Notice how you have \"smart\" everything these days? From personal assistants like Amazon's Alexa to fitness trackers to security systems to refrigerators that can notify you when you're out of ice, your world is becoming inundated with machines that are generating data; this is often called *machine data*. The internet of things is the network upon which these systems run. No matter what the data source, all these examples have something in common: generation of thousands of records per minute. \n",

Kafka servers store all incoming messages from *publishers* (think data generating things) and then allows them to be picked up and read by *consumers* (think data using things). It is up to the consumer to subscribe to the data they need, and they can pick it up when it is convenient.  This is often in real time, but it does not have to be.\n",

Consumers can receive the data as it comes out, in a wide variety of ways, including database connectors. You can also add in an optional *stream processor*, which will transform unstructured data as it comes in and then send it along to the connectors/consumers.\n",

Since it was truly built to integrate with Hadoop, it has built in data sinks for HDFS and for HBase.  This is particularly nice because neither HDFS nor HBase like having a lot of connections to them, so you can use Flume as a buffer between where your data is coming from and where you are storing it.  This also provides a nice little backup, so that you don't end up adding in more data than HDFS or HBase can handle at one time. \n",

On the large side, you can have batches of data where you look at all the data for a year, or maybe a quarter.  That level is easy to manage without fancy big data software, though.  When you're talking batches in Spark Streaming, you're talking about batching data as small as by the second! Sometimes that is referred to as a *micro batch* because of the nature of its size.\n",

Next, *DStream*, or *Discretized Stream*, generates all those RDDs and performs whatever actions you want Spark to take.  The actions are those available in Spark 1.0, which you will encounter soon. These results help maintain *stateful* data, or data that is long-lived and persists beyond your batch.

You can think of a window like a snapshot - it only shows you the last hour as it is right now.  In another minute, that window will look differently, because now that window has slid across time.  A window at 12:00pm will look differently than the window at 12:01pm, because now you have gained one new minute and lost one old one.\n",

Structured streaming is advantageous, because the code looks pretty darn similar to what you would use if you weren't using real-time data, and you can pass your streamed data directly into Spark MLLib if that is required, without further processing.\n",

While Spark Streaming works with incredibly small micro-batches, small enough that streaming feels like it is real time, Storm really is real-time processing, since it works off of each individual data event you have. You basically have less than a second lag time in processing, which is cool, but a little overkill for most data situations.\n",

The stream is formatted continuously as tuples. This stream comes from the *spout* or spouts, which is the source of data.  Spouts can be things such as Kafka or pretty much any other data source you can imagine. The output are *bolts*, which is the the data as it is processed, transformed, and/or aggregated.  Because this really is true real-time data, there are no final results - the bolts just keep going on and on and on. In fact, Storm will keep running until you explicitly tell it to stop!\n",

Although you can run Storm in any language you want, by and large, folks interact with it in Java.  And you typically need to interact with either of Storm's APIs: *Storm Core* and *Trident*.  Although both work, Storm Core provides you with data at a lower, less-processed level.  When using Storm Core, you have a high probability of receiving individual pieces of data more than once.  If you use Trident, that is a higher-level API that puts an extra layer between you and the data, so that it is processed enough to reduce the chances of accidental duplication.\n",

    "# Cluster Redundancy\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important things about Hadoop is that it is resilient to failure.  When you have so much data, you would **really** feel the loss if something happened to it. It's never good to lose any data due to hardware failure or software glitches, but with a smaller dataset, you may be able to recreate what you've lost or soldier on without it.  If you have all the data your company has ever collected tied up in one system, and it consists of billions of records...well no amount of overtime is going to help you recollect that data. That data is probably the product of a decade or more data collection and the definite record for the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you don't want anything to happen to your data, most big data systems have at least some built-in redundancy mechanisms.\n",

    "# Zookeeper\n",
    "\n",
    "Hadoop already is pretty resilient, but it has one place in which it is not *redundant*, meaning it does not have a backup system - the Master Node. If you remember back a few lessons, the Master Node keeps track of the rest of the cluster.  It has a list of where data is located and what is being done with that data. With such an important job, you can imagine how much trouble your cluster would be in if the Master Node failed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there is a solution to this single point of failure in the Master Node: *Zookeeper*. Although you can only have one Master Node at a time (ever have the confusion of reporting to two bosses?) Zookeeper keeps a backup Master Node in reserve and keeps track of the processes that are taking place on your active Master Node, so that the backup can hopefully seamlessly take its place in the event of failure.  Zookeeper logs the following information: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Which node is the Master\n",
    "* Which tasks are assigned to each worker\n",
    "* Which workers are currently available\n",
    "\n",
    "Those are the essentials that it would need to take over operations in case the Master Node fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recovering from Partial Failure\n",
    "\n",
    "Zookeeper isn't just helpful when the entirety of the Master Node has failed; it can also assist when you have had partial failure throughout your cluster.  Some of the partial failure situations that Zookeeper can help your cluster recover from include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hard drive failure on a node(s)\n",
    "* Loss of power from storms that temporarily knock out a node(s)\n",
    "* Nodes getting out of sync with each other (also called *drift*)\n",
    "* Issue with time changes that leaves node(s) asynchronized in time\n",
    "\n",
    "Zookeeper does not just help the core Hadoop system either.  It can also provide backup for the following applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "* HBase\n",
    "* High-Availability MapReduce\n",
    "* Apache Drill\n",
    "* Apache Storm\n",
    "* Solr\n",
    "\n",
    "So when partial or total failure in a node/worker takes place, what does Zookeeper do? Well, it will detect the issue, notify the system, and then the system can redistribute the work appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Zookeeper Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "As with many other big data programs, it is useful to understand a little bit about the architecture behind Zookeeper. Zookeeper maintains a connection to the Master and Workers in Hadoop, that is called the *ZK Client*.  You need multiple ZK Clients, or it won't do any good - what if they went down? Therefore, Zookeeper uses a *quorum* system, in which you have an odd number of ZK Clients and they have to agree about the situation.  Otherwise, what would happen if there's a communication error, and Zookeeper gets sucked into it? With a quorum, the majority rules and you reduce the chances of having a split brain scenario where different clusters are working out of sync with the others. \n",
    "\n",
    "How many ZK clients do you need? At least three. But if you want to prepare for the possibility of more than one node failing at once, you'll need at least five.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Znodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Zookeeper sends notifications to something called a *znode* so that you get updates about the status of your cluster. This removes the need for you to continuously ping your cluster for updates to see that all is going well (you don't want to be that annoying helicopter parent, do you?) and thus can save resources. There are two types of znodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ephemeral znodes:** Ephemeral means fleeting, so these are only created when an issue comes up.  It provides auto-notification to you immediately.\n",
    "* **Persistent znodes:** Always around. Helps assign tasks to workers in the event that the Master Node goes down and can help the new Master pick up from where the old one left off. \n",
