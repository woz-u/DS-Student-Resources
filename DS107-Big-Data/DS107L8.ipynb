    "# What is DASK? \n",
    "\n",
    "DASK is a library in Python that allows you to manage parallel processing (think, clusters or multiple cores on your personal computer) in Python.  It easily integrates with Python tools you already know and love, such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn`. Unlike it's predecessor, PySpark, DASK plays nicely with Python and does not have an underlying reliance on Java that can make execution tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of DASK\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main components of DASK: \n",
    "\n",
    "* High-level Collections\n",
    "* Low-level Schedulers\n",
    "\n",
    "The *high-level collections* are functions that will mimic the operations you perform on arrays in `numpy` or on dataframes in `pandas`, but are meant to operate in parallel for data sets that are too big to work on your computer. The *low-level schedulers* are for executing the actual work of parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "DASK is currently being used for all sorts of work, including genome sequencing, modeling of hydrolics and communication, and even in the finance sector.  \n",

    "from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enable Parallel Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Client()` function has arguments for the number of workers, the number of threads per worker that will be used, and for the maximum amount of memory that you will allow it to use. `n_workers=` is the argument to specify the number of workers.  *Workers* are the \"doers\" of your code. *Threads* are how many things a worker can be doing at the same time.  You can think of it like multitasking. The argument `threads_per_worker=` tells Python how many things each worker will need to process at once.  Then the `memory_limit=` function ensures that you don't use so much memory in this work that your computer cannot perform its regular functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead and run the first line of code now in the tutorial to set this environment up. You'll notice that a view pops up on the right hand side for `Dask Task Stream`.
