    "**“Probability”** is not a word most people use every day. However, the concept of probability is on your mind regularly, even daily for most of us.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability is a measure of the likelihood or chance of an event occurring.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is calculated by dividing the number of occurrences of an event by the number of possible occurrences of that same event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever gotten into rush hour traffic, and thought to yourself, *“What are the chances that I get home within 30 minutes?”* Have you ever checked the weather to see what the likelihood that your hike planned for the weekend gets rained out?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are both examples of probability. In layman’s terms, probability is a numerical indication of *“chance”* or *“likelihood”* that something will or will not occur.  But when someone says there *\"…is no chance he is going to make that light,”* there isn’t a lot of math behind the statement – it is just a guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the probability of something happening is determined by taking the number of different ways a *“successful”* outcome can happen, and dividing that by the total number of different ways something can happen - counting both successes and failures together. It is often easiest to illustrate this with examples of things that are familiar to most people.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will spend considerable time describing probability in its simplest forms; however, it is important to note that probability plays a crucial role in data science.  It provides a framework for making statistical inferences and predictions from data. Here are some key ways that probability is used in data science which will be covered in future lessons and Data Science modules.\n",
    "- Hypothesis testing: Probability is used to test hypotheses about data. A hypothesis is tested by calculating the probability that the observed data could have occurred by chance if the hypothesis is true.\n",
    "- Statistical inference: Probability is used to make statistical inferences about data. For example, the probability of observing a particular data point can be used to make inferences about the population from which the data was drawn.\n",
    "- Modeling data: Probability distributions are used to model data and describe how data points are distributed. This allows data scientists to identify patterns and relationships within data and predict outcomes.\n",
    "- Machine learning: Probability is used in machine learning algorithms to model and predict outcomes. For example, Bayesian networks use probabilities to model the relationships between different variables and make predictions based on those relationships.\n",
    "- Decision making: Probability is used to make decisions in data science. For example, decision theory uses probabilities to weigh the potential outcomes of different decisions and choose the one with the highest expected value.\n",

    "\n",
    "Probabilities are often expressed as fractions, percentages, or decimals.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your probability is a fraction, the **numerator** (*the top number*) **must** be smaller than the **denominator** (*the bottom number*).  If you go back to the example of drawing four Jacks from a standard deck of cards, you'll remember that you had 4/52.  However, this fraction can be reduced - meaning that it is not in its simplest form.  Put another way, you could still divide this further. Four goes into 52 thirteen times, so you can change this fraction to be 1/13 instead.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If your probability is a percentage, it must be between 0% and 100%. To convert a number to a percentage, simply multiply it by 100 and add the percentage (%) sign. To convert from a percentage to a number, divide the percentage by 100. This doesn't require a calculator; just move the decimal point two places to the left.\n"

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach #1\n",
    "\n",
    "You could list out all the possible outcomes, and then simply count up all the successful outcomes and divide that number by total possible outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "TTTTT, TTTTH, TTTHT, TTTHH, TTHTT, TTHTH, TTHHT, TTHHH,  \n",
    "THTTT, THTTH, THTHT, THTHH, THHTT, THHTH, THHHT, THHHH,  \n",

    "HHTTT, HHTTH, HHTHT, HHTHH, HHHTT, HHHTH, HHHHT, HHHHH\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 10 outcomes with exactly 3 \"heads,\" so the probability of tossing exactly 3 \"heads\" in 5 tries is 10/32, or about 0.313. The total number of outcomes is 32 - count the list above! \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach sounds easy at first glance, but it has some real weaknesses. It can be tedious to make sure that your list of possible outcomes is complete, and unless you are very methodical about it, mistakes are easily made. It can also be tedious to thoroughly count the number of successes. It is easy to miss one or count one extra, throwing your answer off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, if the possible outcomes become large (and they can get large quickly), it becomes impractical to write them all down. For example, there are 512 possible ways to flip 3 \"heads\" in 9 coin tosses. If you wanted to calculate the number of ways to arrange the first 8 letters of the alphabet, there are over 40,000 ways to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the best approach to solving a probability problem is to try and redefine the problem. So time to look at the 3 \"heads\" problem a different way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is a problem that can be solved mathematically. The previous lesson discussed combinations and this problem is now a question of combinations to determine the number of possible \"*successes*\", or getting 3 \"*heads*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, n is 5, because you are flipping a coin five times, and the x is 3, because you want three heads out of those five times. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you plug it into the combinations equation, you get a total of ten possible ways to get 3 heads out of 5 total coin tosses.  So the number of \"successes,\" or the number of ways that 3 \"heads\" can be flipped, is 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Uppercase C open parentheses five comma three close parentheses equals five factorial divided by open parentheses five minus three close parentheses factorial three factorial equals five factorial divided by two factorial three factorial equals five times four times three times two times one divided by open parentheses two times one close parentheses open parentheses three times two times one close parentheses equals one hundred twenty divided by two times six equals one hundred twenty divided by twelve equals ten.](Media/L02-04.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "But you're not done yet! You have essentially found the numerator of your fraction, and you still need to calculate the denominator, or the number of possible outcomes. For each flip of the coin, there are two unique outcomes. For five consecutive flips of the coin, the number of possible outcomes is 2, happening 5 times, or 2 outcomes raised to the power of 5 flips of the coin, yielding 32:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that this approach yields the exact same result as above: exactly 3 \"heads\" in 5 flips of the coin is 10/32, or about 0.313.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may appear that approach #1 is the preferred approach because it looks easier, and sometimes it is. But as numbers grow larger, or questions become more complex, approach #2 will become the only feasible option.  \n"

    "# Probability of Two Events - The \"And\" Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to calculate the probability of drawing the \"Ace of Spades\" out of a standard deck of cards, you could do it two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Close up of the corner of a black ace of spades playing card.](Media/Probability3.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** By noting there is only one card that is the \"Ace of Spades\", and there are a total of 52 cards, so the traditional approach of successes divided by opportunities would give you 1/52.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** You could also say something like, \"What is the probability of drawing a card, and having it be an Ace **and** a Spade?\" Now this has become two events.\n",
    "\n",
    "    These events are independent, because drawing a Spade doesn't change the probability of drawing an Ace, and drawing an Ace doesn't change the probability of drawing a Spade. The Boolean operator **and** tells you that you should multiply these two separate event probabilities together. The math is different if the events aren't independent. You will get to dependent events later.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * There are 4 Aces, so the probability of drawing an Ace is 4/52, or 1/13 reduced.\n",
    "    * There are 13 Spades, so the probability of drawing a Spade is 13/52, or 1/4 reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability of drawing a card that is an Ace **and** a Spade is (1/13) x (1/4), which equals 1/52, which matches the answer you found above.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Another Example \n",
    "\n",
    "If you flip a coin and roll a 6-sided die, what is the probability that you will get \"heads\" **and** a \"5\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Top left, a nickel balanced on its edge on a surface. Bottom right, a red die with the side with five dots facing upward.](Media/probability4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are all the possible results:\n",

    "* H1\n",
    "* H2\n",
    "* H3\n",

    "* T2\n",
    "* T3\n",
    "* T4\n",
    "* T5\n",
    "* T6\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 12 possible outcomes, and only one of them is H5, so the probability is 1/12.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you treat this as two separate events, then the probability of \"heads\" is 1/2, **and** the probability of a \"5\" is 1/6. Therefore, the probability of \"heads\" **and** \"5\" is:\n",

    "Another example of a non-mutually exclusive situation would be if you were going to calculate the probability of drawing a \"3\" **or** a black card from a standard deck. In this case, it is possible to draw a card that is both a \"3\" and black.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the probability of non-mutually exclusive events, you will find the probability of both events, and then subtract the probability that overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the example above, in which you wanted to draw a three or black card, you will need to first find the probability of drawing a three.  This is 4/52, because you have one 3 for each suit.  Then you will need to find the probability of drawing a black card.  This is 26/52, because there are 13 cards per suit and there are two suits that are colored black (spades and clubs).  Because you have the word **or** in the problem, you know that you should add these together.\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "4/52 + 26/52 = 30/52\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that when you add fractions together, you just need to focus on the numerator, the top number in the fraction.  You leave that bottom number alone. It didn't do anything to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on, if you didn't know about non-mutually exclusive events, this is probably where you'd stop - but the answer would be wrong! Because you know that there are some black threes, you need to then subtract them, because you have counted them twice above - they were counted once in the count of threes, and once in the count of black cards.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, there are only a couple (2) of black  threes.  That means you need to subtract them from your total:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "30/52 - 2/52 = 28/52\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And 28/52 becomes your final answer in fraction form.  If you wanted, you could reduce this fraction down by dividing by 2, to give you 14/26, and then reduce again by dividing by 2 to give you 7/13.  You could also convert this to a decimal or a percentage, which would give you .54 or a 54% likelihood that you draw either a black card or a three.  When you apply good old common sense, this seems right - half the suits are black, and so you would expect the number to be over 50%.  \n",

For example, if you are trying to pick two cards, you can either put the first card you drew back into the deck, or leave it out on the table.  If you put it back in the deck, then the probability doesn't change.  But, if you leave it out - *then guess what?* Now you are trying to pick a card from 51 cards in the deck, not 52, and your odds will change. \n",

The probability of drawing two aces in a row is 16 / 2704.  You could reduce this down a little by dividing by 4 (as tere are 4 aces in a deck), to get 4/676.  You could then reduce it down even more by dividing by 4 again, so the fraction becomes 1/169.  You could also convert this to a decimal or a percentage, which would be .005 or .5%. \n",

In this lesson, you learned the basic rules of probability, how to calculate the probability of one or more events together using boolean operators, how to deal with special situations like non-mutually exclusive events as well as probability without replacement, and how to calculate the number of options when order doesn't matter (**combinations**) or when order does matter (**permutations**). You have gained a basic grasp on calculating probabilities! You probably never thought you would but you did and I'm proud of you!\n",
