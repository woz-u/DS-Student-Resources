    "# Populations and Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following scenario: You work for the power company in a large metropolitan area. There are about 1.7 million households in the area the power company serves. You are asked to find out some information about the customers of the power company.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Smoke coming out of a factories smokestacks.](Media/L04-02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the things you are asked to find out aren't just located in a database somewhere; you actually have to determine a way to go to the customer base and find out this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, maybe you need to find out if a customer has an additional alternative source of energy at their home, whether it is solar, gas, wind, or something else (basement nuclear reactor, maybe?); whether they have 5 or more appliances that are energy star rated; and how many people live in the home.\n",
    "\n",
    "You realize that finding this information out for all 1.7 million households is impractical. It would take years, and thousands of hours to complete the data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is *sampling*. Sampling is when you take a subset of the population and make assertions about the entire population by just observing a small subset of that population. You don't need to talk to every household, you can just ask some of the households, and then extrapolate that information from the sample to the whole city.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A visualization of the sampling process. There are twelve items that represent people in a population. Item two, five, eight, and ten are pulled from the total population and placed in subsets, or samples, of the overall population.](Media/DescriptiveStats1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a risk involved with this: since you are purposely excluding most of the households in the city, you are obtaining incomplete information. You can take multiple samples and they will all be slightly different, with no way to tell which one is the most accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, your workload is dramatically decreased if you decide to sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, you would consider all of the households in the metro area as the population, and the subset of households from which you will get the info as the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Sample? \n",
    "\n",
    "Why not just observe all members of a population, rather than just sample? If you measured everyone or everything in the population, you would get an accurate measure of the population, rather than by estimating it through sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is true that sometimes all of the members of a population are easily measured, for instance, a machine may collect data from every item manufactured, much more often, it is impractical.  For instance, imagine taking a political poll during a presidential election cycle.  There is no way you have the time or resources to ask all 220 million potential voters about their opinion. Sampling is the only practical approach.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sampling Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling was proposed as a method of collecting data long ago. Collecting data is usually thought of as being fairly expensive in both resources and time. By sampling you can reduce the amount of data to be collected, thereby conserving resources; however, you can risk taking a sample that is not representative of the population as a whole and then having inaccurate results.\n",

The best way to do this is to assign all candidates a unique number, and then have a random number generator select which of those candidates should be a part of the sample. This method provides the best samples, but may not always be done because it can logistically be difficult or expensive.\n",

    "Most academics believe that convenience sampling should be avoided whenever possible. In reality, most samples have at least some elements of convenience in them. The trick is to approach the convenience sampling in a thoughtful rather than a \"lazy\" manner and to incorporate some aspects of randomization within the constraints of the convenience sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A manufacturer is interested in how much of their output gets returned for being defective. They want to sample all returned materials and then read through the description of reasons for the return, because some of it gets returned for defects, but there are many other reasons for returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can't randomly sample all of the returns data, because most of it is returned through a vendor. Some vendors won't share the information, some won't collect useable data, and some collect plenty of data but it is in Russian, or Chinese, or some other language the manufacturer cannot read.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the manufacturer carefully selects the vendors that provide useful data, and then use some randomization to look at returns for different products, from different vendors, and at different times of the year. They purposely ignore a lot of data because it just isn't useful to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Systematic sampling doesn't make a bunch of sense in the 10th-graders example, because you haven't made the sampling any easier than simple random sampling would be. All you have done is systematically selected students instead of randomly picked them. However, if you were auditing quality on a manufactured item such as a wireless keyboard, and you are standing in the warehouse to select the keyboards you will test, doing systematic sampling makes perfect sense because you have shelves and shelves of finished product waiting to be shipped. Pulling out every 40th keyboard is no problem at all.\n",

    "## Why Should You Sample? \n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of reasons. In general terms, you sample because you want to know something about a bigger set, usually called the population. Measuring the entire population is never practical, and usually impossible. Sampling helps you to develop estimates of what is going on with the whole population, and usually can provide you with a confidence interval around that estimate.\n",

    "\n",
    "## How Should You Sample? \n",
    "\n",
    "Randomization is important, but so is practicality. Complete random sampling usually requires lots of resources. If you work for a facility that is only concerned with research, then it might be justified to use randomization in all cases. If you work for a production facility, then randomization usually gets in the way of manufacturing and selling goods, and the production manager would just prefer not give you any goods for experimentation at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most businesses, data are collected in huge piles, because it is cheap and easy to do. For instance, if you work in a peanut butter plant, it might just be that every single jar of peanut butter gets weighed. There might be a device on the production line that weighs each jar in line as it zooms to the next station.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't even have to go out of your way to have tons of weight data available to you. Some of those places might crank out tens of thousands of jars each day. If you had to run some sort of experiment on weights, there is no reason to somehow randomly sample the weights on a given day. It makes more sense to just use the data that are available to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the health and safety inspector at the peanut butter plant might have to collect bacteria data on the peanut butter, and it requires a chemical analysis that is a bit laborious. The inspector would never presume to test every single jar. Instead, he or she would develop some sort of sampling plan, such as 7 jars per batch of raw peanuts per shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then they would utilize randomization, pick the jars, do the bacteria analysis, and then infer the results to the rest of the jars from that batch and shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "If they determine there is a bacteria problem, they will likely quarantine the affected batch and either scrap it, or ship it to a location with less restrictive bacteria requirements for peanut butter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from Lesson 4 that there are several different types of sampling: simple random, systematic, cluster, stratified, and convenience sampling. These are ideal approaches to sampling; in real life, sampling is usually a hybrid of two or more of these types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convenience sampling is the least desirable, but frankly, it is rare for a sample plan to not have some element of convenience included. Random sampling is the most desirable, but also often the most impractical. If you are able to at least incorporate some level of randomization in your sampling, you are probably better off.\n",

    "## Why Analyze Data? \n",
    "\n",
    "As a historical note, much of statistics today originated in agriculture. It was very common, for instance, to do a study to see what type of soil and what type of fertilizer worked best for cotton yields. This was typically done by taking large plots of land of different soil types (sandy, rocky, rich, etc.) and creating many sub plots of the large plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub plots would then be randomly selected, and cotton would be planted. Maybe 20 sub plots in the sandy region would be selected, and then 5 different fertilizers would each be used on 4 sub plots. Cotton was planted, and harvested, and the yield would be calculated for each sub plot. Then, a large statistical analysis would be conducted to determine the best soil and fertilizer combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be thinking \"Why bother with analysis? Just check and see which combination yields the most...\" Sometimes if the differences are large, you would be correct - you don't need a data scientist to detect large differences. Most people with a bit of common sense can detect those large changes. But if the difference is subtle, common sense might not be able to detect small but significant differences.\n",

    "Hopefully some time within the next 10 years, driverless cars will become ubiquitous in society. They will be loaded with sensors and redundant systems, but when you clear away all the dust and look at the simplest things that will be happening, it will usually boil down to some sort of statistical calculation to make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a human can easily distinguish between a small dog running across the road vs. a plastic grocery bag blowing across the road. How do you get a machine to distinguish that with a high level of reliability? You don't want to make a mistake here.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your car thinks it is a grocery bag and can therefore be run over without consequence, but it is a dog, that would be tragic. On the other hand, you don't want your car screeching to a halt every time a bag blows across the road because it might be a dog. The decision making process is highly dependent on years of statistical analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "* You have invented a new drug to treat hypertension. You are sure your drug is better than the most commonly used current drug, but as you develop a hypothesis, you hypothesize that the two drugs are exactly the same in effectiveness. What you really want to do is prove yours is better, but you will start by assuming they are both equally good.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are taking a survey and you believe that the crab cakes sold at \"The Shack\" are better than the crab cakes sold at \"Seafood Supreme.\" Your hypothesis should be that both crab cakes are equally desirable to customers, and you hope to use data to disprove the hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You want to compare baseball players from two different eras, and you think one is better than the other. Your hypothesis is that they are equally skilled, and then you hope to use data to disprove that hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You want to collect some data to see if movie preference is dependent on gender. Your hypothesis is that movie preference is the same for both genders, and then collect data to see if the hypothesis should be rejected or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a hypothesis, usually you actually come up with two. The first is called the \"`null`\" hypothesis, and this is how it is represented:\n",
    "\n",
    "![H subscript zero, the symbol representing the null hypothesis.](Media/L08-12.png)\n",

    "There is another hypothesis with every hypothesis test. It is called the \"`alternative`\" hypothesis, and is represented like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![H subscript lowercase a, the symbol representing the alternative hypothesis.](Media/L08-13.png)\n",

    "* Better than\n",
    "* Worse than\n",
    "* Different\n",
    "\n",

Your hypothesis should be that both crab cakes are equally desirable to customers, and you hope to use data to disprove the hypothesis.
