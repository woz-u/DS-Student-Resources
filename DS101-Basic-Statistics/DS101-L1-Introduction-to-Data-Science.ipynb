    "To give you an idea of the tasks you will face as a data scientist, let's walk through what the industry calls the Data Science Pipeline, which describes the pathway through which data flows. There are **four basic types** of tasks in the data science pipeline: **engineering**, **preparation**, **analytics**, and **operations**.  This course will give you a taste for all of them, but you may choose to specialize as you apply for jobs if a particular area calls to you.\n",

    "* **Raw Data:** Data can be collected in many ways, from pencil-and-paper surveys to complex computer databases.  It's a sure bet, however, that no matter what way information is collected, it will not be easily extracted or usable right away. As a data scientist, there are times when you will decide what data should be collected and the format it should be collected in, which makes things easier. However, there are many other times when you will be consulted far after data has already been gathered.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Extraction:** Extraction is the process of pulling the data you'll need for analysis out of storage, so that it can be used. If data is being stored in a database, this typically involves querying in a programming language called SQL (pronounced \"sequel\" or \"S-Q-L\").\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Wrangling:** Because your data will invariably be collected, stored, or even extracted in a format that is difficult to use, you will need to \"wrangle\" it to ensure it is in the format you need for the particular analysis you'll perform.  Wrangling covers a wide variety of operations, but can include putting multiple datasets together, adding or removing data, recoding data, and changing the shape of your data. Data wrangling is typically done in software with statistical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Cleaning:** Data in the real world is messy, so give it a good scrubbing down! Removing any data entry errors, impossible values, and outliers that could bias your data will ensure that you're giving stakeholders the most accurate and realistic information possible.  You may also need to transform your data to ensure it meets the assumptions for the particular analysis you want to run.  By doing so, you're using the statistical test the way it was intended, which again will improve the accuracy of your results. Like data wrangling, data cleaning is typically done in statistical software.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Analysis / Machine Learning:** Now that your data has been extracted, wrangled, and cleaned, it's time to finally run analyses to test hypotheses and determine how various pieces of data relate to each other.  While it's a data scientist's job to be well versed in advanced analytic techniques such as machine learning, modeling, and other multivariate tests, often you'll find that simple analytics such as determining the frequency with which something occurs or finding the average will do the trick. Data analysis will take place in statistical software, and if your dataset is large, then it may involve Big Data software such as **Spark**, **Hadoop**, or **Hive** to appropriately process and analyze data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Visualization / Reporting:** After you have run your analyses, simple or complicated, it's time to report them out in a meaningful way so that others can take action! Often this process involves data visualization, also called \"*data viz*\", in which you create graphics that not only catch the eye but also are capable of explaining complex analysis at a glance.  Data visualization can be done in statistical software, but often their visualization modules can be difficult and time consuming to use. Therefore, specific software like Tableau can be used to make visualizations easy, or others may branch into more typical software for visualization, such as the Microsoft Suite or Adobe Photoshop. Reporting will typically take place in a format that everyone can use and understand, such as a text document report or a slide show.\n",
    "    * In the past, data visualization and reporting were one of the keys areas where statistics fell down.  Visuals, when present at all, were usually clunky and hard to understand. With the evolution of data science, there is more emphasis being placed upon this last step.  If no one can understand the brilliant work you did, they won't be able to use it - and then you'll have wasted all that time. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Even though there is a whole chain of events that take place before data reporting, ironically, the final results are usually all a stakeholder will care about! It is, however, crucial that all these \"*behind-the-scenes*\" steps take place; without them, you run the risk of having inaccurate results that could mislead your company. \n",

    "## Data Analysis Software\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many, many different types of software out there to help you analyze data.  They all have different strengths, industry applications, and costs associated.  Once you learn the basics about the analyses and their applications, most can be run in any program, given you get familiar with the software.  You will cover Python and R in this course because they are open source **(read: free!)** and are also the most commonly asked for data analysis programs at this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order from most to least common:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python:** Although Python is an object-oriented programming language that can be used for dozens of different purposes, data scientists have made it their own with a series of packages that are Data Science specific. They even created their own version of Python, Anaconda, that runs a shell called Jupyter Notebooks, which allow for easy running of code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Packages like Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pyplot, Scipy, and Stats all allow data scientists to wrangle, analyze, and visualize data with ease. We will cover all these and more!\n",
    "\n",
    "* **R:** R is another open source program like Python, but it focuses on statistics-specific tasks, which can sometimes make it easier to run certain types of analyses.  There are oodles of different libraries (the package equivalent in R) to download for a wide variety of different tasks. The shell most often used with R is R Studio, though you can also use Jupyter - that's what the \"R\" at the end stands for!\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SAS:** Standing for `Statistical Analysis System`, SAS is most often used by businesses for data analysis. They have rather expensive corporate licenses, but SAS is very powerful and can process relatively large datasets (around half a million records) easily.  Because SAS is not open source, it can be slightly more difficult to find resources on learning it, but the code is typically more uniform than Python or R and it is much less likely that the program itself will have bugs or errors. Until recently, SAS required pure data science coding, but with the advent of SAS Enterprise Guide (EG), now users with less expertise in SAS can \"point and click\" their way through a wide variety of data wrangling tasks and statistical analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SPSS:** `Statistical Package for Social Sciences` (SPSS), is statistics software originally used in psychology and other social sciences.  It is also often used in medical research.  Although SPSS is not as powerful as Python, R, or SAS, and cannot handle extremely large datasets, its main advantage is a full range of \"point and click\" options for even the most advanced statistical analyses, with additional add-on packages for things like structural equation modeling.  SPSS makes it easy for a coding novice to still run and interpret analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **MATLAB:** MATLAB stands for `Matrix Laboratory`, and is software used for complex modeling techniques and simulations, often related to the life sciences.  For instance, if you wanted to model the population growth of a particular animal, your absolute number one tool would be MATLAB.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **MiniTab:** MiniTab was developed at Pennsylvania State University and was designed for Six Sigma business usage.  Like SPSS, it is easy to use, but trades that off for power and analysis complexity. It is also very expensive, though there are options to rent it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stata:** Yet another stats package! Less popular than the others, probably because its use is typically confined to researchers.  You may run across Stata if you're interested in pursuing the fields of economics, sociology, political science, or epidemiology.  It can handle a large number of variables and records, but can become pricey depending on the options you choose.\n",

    "None of the software listed above can handle truly staggering amounts of data. That's where \"*Big Data*\" comes into play, with the following software:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hadoop:** Hadoop uses distributed processing to run analyses on large datasets. While it was the first big data program out there, analysis is somewhat limited and can take longer than some of the other big data programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Spark:** Spark also uses distributed processing, but can stream and analyze data in real time much better than Hadoop.  Spark also can utilize a wide variety of analyses, including machine learning algorithms. However, Spark is not ideal for multiple users at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hive:** Hive is a SQL-to-Hadoop engine that allows you to query large amounts of data with batch processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Visualization and Reporting Software\n",
    "\n",
    "Although visualization can absolutely be done within any of the data analysis software programs listed above, it is often quicker and easier to use other programs, and other programs will provide you with more options and flexibility as well. A lot of visualization and reporting is done in software with which most folks are familiar.  For instance, don't underestimate the Microsoft Suite of products such as PowerPoint and Word for creating visuals and reports.  These programs have the advantage of being common knowledge, so your stakeholders will typically be able to open the documents you have created easily. It's in a format that's familiar to them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is also software that allows you to advance your graphics skills.  Some are pretty common, such as Adobe Photoshop or Paint. Others are a little more specialized, like Tableau, but nevertheless, still relatively easy to use.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tableau:** Tableau was created with the field of data visualization in mind.  It is the definitive software for viz and many companies are looking for data scientists with experience in Tableau.  Tableau can also run a few very simple analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **PowerBI:** [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) Make informed, confident business decisions by putting data-driven insights into everyone’s hands.\n"
