    "# The Poisson Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson distribution is elegant and simple. It is used to model situations in which a given number of events would occur in a fixed interval of time or space. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples Using the Poisson Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples are things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The number of bugs of a particular type in a square foot patch of lawn\n",
    "* The number of pieces of mail received at your home in a typical day\n",
    "* The number of customers arriving between 10:00am and 10:30am to a store\n",
    "* The number of defects found in 30 feet of pipe\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions for the Poisson Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some assumptions that must be met in order for the Poisson distribution to be a good model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The occurrence of an event does not affect the probability of a following event taking place\n",
    "* The number of events can occur in a given interval is countable and a whole number\n",
    "* The long term rate at which events occur is constant\n",
    "* Two events cannot happen in exactly the same instant\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson distribution is simple, because there is only one parameter. The mean of the distribution is the same as the variance (which, if you recall, is just the standard deviation squared).\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of the distribution is dependent on the value of the mean. For the Poisson distribution, the mean is represented by the Greek letter \"lambda,\" and it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![The Greek letter lambda, which is used to represent the mean for the Poisson distribution.](Media/L07-06.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remember that lambda can take on any value, it does not need to be a whole number. However, the number of events in the time interval of interest **does** need to be a whole number (0, 1, 2...).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you may own a fruit stand and you sell an average of 2.7 cantaloupes each hour, but the actual count is never 2.7. Sometimes you sell 4, sometimes 2, sometimes none at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the Poisson distribution for several different values of lambda:\n",
    "\n",
    "![The Poisson distribution for lambda values of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine.](Media/L07-07.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on the Poisson distribution for lambda = 2, or the red distribution. Even though the distribution is drawn as a smooth curve, the only values it can actually take on are 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to look at this graph and understand it, do the following: For a Poisson distribution with a lambda of 2, if you want to determine the probability of a 0, you would look vertically right above the 0 and see where it hits the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the curve is directly above the 0 at about 0.14, meaning that the probability of getting a zero when something is distributed as a Poisson with a lambda of 2 is equal to 0.14. How about a 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "By observing the graph directly vertically up from the 1 on the horizontal axis, and then extrapolating that point to the vertical axis, you can see that the probability of a 1 is about 0.26.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find the probability using the eyeball method and the graph, you can construct the following probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 0 => p ~ 0.14\n",
    "* 1 => p ~ 0.26\n",
    "* 2 => p ~ 0.28\n",
    "* 3 => p ~ 0.16\n",
    "* 4 => p ~ 0.09\n",
    "* 5 => p ~ 0.04\n",
    "* 6 => p ~ 0.02\n",
    "* 7 or higher => p ~ 0.00\n",
    "\n",
    "If you add all these probabilities up, they should be pretty close to 1, because that forms a complete set of possible outcomes. Based on your eyeball analysis, the total of the probabilities is 0.99, which is not bad for a quick and dirty analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eyeball analysis is fine for approximating, but there are two problems...it might not be as precise as you want it, and if your lambda is something like 2.7, then there is no graph to represent that.\n",
    "\n",

    "# The Exponential Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponential distribution is a large family of distributions, but you will focus on only a single aspect, and it is somewhat related to the Poisson distribution discussed earlier in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson distribution described the number of events within a certain defined interval, whether time or distance. The responses were discrete, meaning that you could have 0 events, 1 event, 2 events, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponential distribution has a continuous response instead of discrete, because it is used to describe the amount of time between two sequential events. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Example\n",
    "\n",
    "A local fast-food chain has a drive thru window that is open 24 hours a day. During the hours of 10:30 AM and 11:00 PM, there is more likely than not a car sitting in the drive thru lane wanting some food. But in the dead of night, there usually aren't that many cars that come by.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are studying the hours from 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM. Historical data tells you that between those hours, you will typically have 17.8 customers in the drive thru window. With this information, you could create a Poisson distribution with mean (lambda) = 17.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it is probably a good idea to keep an eye on units. The mean of 17.8 represents 17.8 cars per 2 hour period, or 17.8 cars per period.\n",

    "# The Bathtub Curve\n",

    "\n",
    "![The bathtub curb placed on a chart. The x axis of the chart represents time. The y axis represents failure rate. The area of the chart has three vertical sections, decreasing failure rate on the left, constant failure rate in the middle, and increasing failure rate on the right. Four lines are plotted, including observed failure rate, the early quote infant mortality quote failure, constant open parentheses random close parentheses failures, and wear out failures.](Media/L07-18.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The bathtub curve is the blue curve in the picture above. You can see two dashed lines - one in red and one in yellow - that added together make up the bathtub curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## \"Infant Mortality\" Failure Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in the diagram, the red dashed line represents the \"infant mortality\" failure rate of an electronic device. The name is kind of morbid, but the concept is probably intuitive to most readers. When anything is manufactured, there is a certain percentage that will result in a manufacturing fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your company manufactures rubber chickens, the fails are usually pretty easy to spot...maybe the eyes are printed in the middle of the back, or there are three legs. All you need is a couple of quality assurance (QA) inspectors to pull out the fails before the rubber chickens go wherever they go for retail.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, electronics are hard to evaluate by visual means. A manufacturing fail and a manufacturing success can look exactly the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "No manufacturer wants to send a bunch of manufacturing fails to a retailer for sale.  It is in everybody's best interest to separate out the manufacturing fails before sending inventory to the retailer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent this as much as possible, the manufacturer will do what is called \"burn-in\". If you go to any semiconductor manufacturer in the world, it is a good bet they have a test floor as big as several football fields. On that test floor there will often be hundreds of testers, each holding as many as 250,000 die to be burned in.\n",
    "\n",
    "What they are looking for is to use the semiconductors enough in simulated workload, and cull out all of the infant fails. If you look on the red dashed curve, that would be the point at which the \"steepness\" of the failure rate flattens out.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wear Out Failures\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other side of the distribution, pretty much everything wears out eventually. The \"wear out failures\" as indicated by the dashed yellow line are relatively flat to begin with. Most stuff doesn't wear out immediately after manufacture.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as time goes on, the wear out failure rate will begin to increase, and the curve gets steeper. Even in industries where manufactured goods are not terribly complex, a good manufacturer wants a pretty good feel for when the wear out curve starts to steepen.\n",
    "\n",
    "They don't want their warranties or guarantees to extend into the steep part of the wear out curve; it costs them too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, putting both of these curves together creates the bathtub curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data Scientist's Role\n",
    "\n",
    "The job of the data scientist in this scenario could be complex modelling with great detail for a highly sophisticated piece of electronic equipment with lots of electronic parts, or it could be a pretty simple \"connect the dots\" type of curve if the complexity of the manufactured goods is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a concept called \"planned obsolescence.\" This means that a manufacturer doesn't want your product to last forever. They want it to wear out, or become outdated, so that you will have to replace it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is possible for a manufacturer to shorten the width of a bathtub curve by doing things like using plastic parts instead of metal parts at a critical point in a piece of equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary of the bathtub curve, companies that utilize a data scientist to help them not only define what their bathtub curve looks like, but use it to make good decisions about manufacturing, warranties, and extended warranties are ahead of their competitors.\n",

    "# Chi-Square Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-Square distribution is not really suitable for modeling. It is mostly used for hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general terms, the chi-square distribution is a good way of measuring how an assumed distribution matches up with a sampled distribution when you have categorical, not continuous, data. Time to look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Suppose you are polling for a general election. You have three candidates: Abernathy, Boykins, and Calendario. As you are polling, you ask two questions.  First, who is your preferred candidate, and second, what age group are you in.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have collected a bunch of data, you construct a table that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A table showing the names of three political candidates, the number of people who vote for each and the age range of these votes, the totals by candidate, and the totals by age range.](Media/L07-24.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you scrutinize this table, you will realize that Abernathy is much more popular among the younger voters than Boykins, whereas Boykins appeals to the 30 - 49 year old group.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the differences were a bit more subtle, how would you decide if there was a candidate preference by voter age?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to tackle a problem like this, you need to assume that there is **no difference** between age groups regarding candidate preference. With this assumption, you then calculate the \"expected\" counts in each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, 90 out of 272 voters overall like Abernathy, or about 33%. If each age group liked Abernathy at 33% also, then for the 18 - 29 year olds, you would expect there to be about 0.33 x 84 = 27.8 voters for Abernathy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what the table of \"expected\" values would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A table showing the names of three political candidates, the number of people who vote for each and the age range of these votes, the totals by candidate, and the totals by age range. The table shows quote expected quote values.](Media/L07-25.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you notice, all of the column totals and row totals are still the same, it is just that the expected counts in each cell have been re-balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without talking about a lot of theory, it turns out that if you do a bunch of math on the \"observed\" cell counts and \"expected\" cell counts in each cell, the total will be distributed as a Chi-Square variable. In fact, it is called the *Chi-Square statistic*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the calculation will not be presented here. There are tons of web applications that will calculate it for you, so there is no need to learn how to do it by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the Chi-Square statistic value is 44.4. Much like has been done with the *z*-score and the *t*-score, you can use a web based calculator to determine the probability that a Chi-Square statistic would be as large or larger than 44.4, and it turns out the probability is about 0.000001.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, it should essentially never happen. In terms of the voting preferences, if you assume there is no difference in preferences among age groups, and then get a probability this small, it forces you to go back and question the assumptions that were originally made. The data have led you to believe that there is in fact a difference in voting preferences among the different age groups.\n",

    "\n",
    "The word \"independent\" means that the two variables are not associated with each other. In the case of a test of independence, it simply means that neither variable depends on the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing for independence is a bit different than all of the other tests you have run so far. Up to this point, there has always been some sort of numerical comparison to be made, whether it is a mean value against a standard, or two means against each other. For a test of independence, this is a bit tougher than the other approaches. What happens here is independence is assumed, and then the number of expected counts in each cell of a table is calculated. Then, the expected counts are subtracted from the observed counts. Finally, those differences are added up, and they become the `χ2` test statistic. The test statistic is then converted into a *p* value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation for the χ2 test statistic is too complex to do by hand, so you will be learning it in MS Excel now, and in other programming languages later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The larger the value of the χ2 test statistic, the smaller the *p* value will be. Once the χ2 test statistic gets large enough for the *p* value to be less than α, you will reject the null hypothesis, just like you did for *t*-tests.\n",

This means that the number of traffic accident deaths in Finland is influenced by gender and/or Friday the 13th.  Taking a look at the difference between the actual cells and the expected cells, you can see that there are far more traffic accident deaths NOT on Friday the 13th then on Friday the 13th.  This should make sense to you - there are many more days that are Fridays that are NOT the 13th. This is a good indication that the data reporting is flawed; counts will be biased, because of the number of days.  A better way for someone to have reported this data was the percentage of total accidents per day that resulted in death.  \n",
