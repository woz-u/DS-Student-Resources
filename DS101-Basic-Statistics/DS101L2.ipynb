If you go back to the example of drawing four Jacks from a standard deck of cards, you'll remember that you had 4/52.  However, this fraction can be reduced - meaning that it is not in its simplest form.  Put another way, you could still divide this further. Four goes into 52 thirteen times, so you can change this fraction to be 1/13 instead.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If your probability is a percentage, it must be between 0% and 100%. To convert a number to a percentage, simply multiply it by 100 and add the percentage (%) sign. To convert from a percentage to a number, divide the percentage by 100. This doesn't require a calculator; just move the decimal point two places to the left.\n"

    "```text\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 10 outcomes with exactly 3 \"heads,\" so the probability of tossing exactly 3 \"heads\" in 5 tries is 10/32, or about 0.313. The total number of outcomes is 32 - count the list above! \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach sounds easy at first glance, but it has some real weaknesses. It can be tedious to make sure that your list of possible outcomes is complete, and unless you are very methodical about it, mistakes are easily made. It can also be tedious to thoroughly count the number of successes. It is easy to miss one or count one extra, throwing your answer off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, if the possible outcomes become large (and they can get large quickly), it becomes impractical to write them all down. For example, there are 512 possible ways to flip 3 \"heads\" in 9 coin tosses. If you wanted to calculate the number of ways to arrange the first 8 letters of the alphabet, there are over 40,000 ways to do that.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Approach #2\n",

    "Often the best approach to solving a probability problem is to try and redefine the problem. So time to look at the 3 \"heads\" problem a different way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is a problem that can be solved mathematically. The previous lesson discussed combinations and this problem is now a question of combinations to determine the number of possible \"*successes*\", or getting 3 \"*heads*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, n is 5, because you are flipping a coin five times, and the x is 3, because you want three heads out of those five times. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you plug it into the combinations equation, you get a total of ten possible ways to get 3 heads out of 5 total coin tosses.  So the number of \"successes,\" or the number of ways that 3 \"heads\" can be flipped, is 10.\n",

    "\n",
    "But you're not done yet! You have essentially found the numerator of your fraction, and you still need to calculate the denominator, or the number of possible outcomes. For each flip of the coin, there are two unique outcomes. For five consecutive flips of the coin, the number of possible outcomes is 2, happening 5 times, or 2 outcomes raised to the power of 5 flips of the coin, yielding 32:\n",

The Boolean operator **and** tells you that you should multiply these two separate event probabilities together. The math is different if the events aren't independent. You will get to dependent events later.\n",

    "\n",
    "Another example of a non-mutually exclusive situation would be if you were going to calculate the probability of drawing a \"3\" **or** a black card from a standard deck. In this case, it is possible to draw a card that is both a \"3\" and black.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the probability of non-mutually exclusive events, you will find the probability of both events, and then subtract the probability that overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the example above, in which you wanted to draw a three or black card, you will need to first find the probability of drawing a three.  This is 4/52, because you have one 3 for each suit.  Then you will need to find the probability of drawing a black card.  This is 26/52, because there are 13 cards per suit and there are two suits that are colored black (spades and clubs).  Because you have the word **or** in the problem, you know that you should add these together.\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "4/52 + 26/52 = 30/52\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that when you add fractions together, you just need to focus on the numerator, the top number in the fraction.  You leave that bottom number alone. It didn't do anything to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on, if you didn't know about non-mutually exclusive events, this is probably where you'd stop - but the answer would be wrong! Because you know that there are some black threes, you need to then subtract them, because you have counted them twice above - they were counted once in the count of threes, and once in the count of black cards.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, there are only a couple (2) of black  threes.  That means you need to subtract them from your total:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "30/52 - 2/52 = 28/52\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And 28/52 becomes your final answer in fraction form.  If you wanted, you could reduce this fraction down by dividing by 2, to give you 14/26, and then reduce again by dividing by 2 to give you 7/13.  You could also convert this to a decimal or a percentage, which would give you .54 or a 54% likelihood that you draw either a black card or a three.  When you apply good old common sense, this seems right - half the suits are black, and so you would expect the number to be over 50%.  \n",

    "Another tricky situation is probability without replacement.  Up to this point, as you have gone through examples, you have always assumed that if you were picking multiple things, they would be put back.  For example, if you are trying to pick two cards, you can either put the first card you drew back into the deck, or leave it out on the table.  If you put it back in the deck, then the probability doesn't change.  But, if you leave it out - *then guess what?* Now you are trying to pick a card from 51 cards in the deck, not 52, and your odds will change. \n",

The probability of drawing two aces in a row is 16 / 2704.  You could reduce this down a little by dividing by 4 (as tere are 4 aces in a deck), to get 4/676.  You could then reduce it down even more by dividing by 4 again, so the fraction becomes 1/169.  You could also convert this to a decimal or a percentage, which would be .005 or .5%. \n",
