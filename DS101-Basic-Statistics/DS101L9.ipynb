    "\n",
    "In DSO104, data wrangling and data visualization will be discussed thoroughly. In this lesson, you will learn the foundations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world, data is at your fingertips and perfectly formatted for analysis. Do you ever watch one of those crime shows where there are one or more computer geniuses retrieving data? You can watch someone do something on TV that only requires a few moments, when in real life, it could take hours at best, and possibly days or weeks at worst.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you set aside all of the realistic privacy issues, filtering data down is not a trivial exercise. It is true that if the same retrieve-merge-sort-filter routine gets used over and over, it is easily automated. But to do it on demand and on the fly is a large task. The process of retrieving, cleaning, and reformatting data is **VERY** time consuming. It is often more time consuming than the actual analysis that takes place.\n",

Once you look at the data in the column, a few more columns become obvious, but the vast majority of them are impossible to interpret. For example, column J is labelled \"PREDDEG\". You probably have no idea what that stands for. You could guess that it has something to do with a degree, because the data pertain to colleges, but aside from that, you're probably clueless. Furthermore, the values appear to be coded, because a quick scan tells me that they are all 3, 2, or 1. What does that mean? Is it categorical data that is indexed? Is it ordinal data?\n",

You will get the expert's help much more willingly if you have already tried to translate and understand as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is very typical of available data - especially if it comes from the government. It is a shining example of data being easy and cheap to collect, but usually not much thought is put into whether it is stored in a format that is easy to extract or use.\n",

    "## A Few Visualizations \n",
    "\n",
    "It is always a good idea to make some quick and dirty graphs from your data if you have the time, which will allow you to see at a glance if there is something terribly wrong with your data. Making a few graphs is typically much quicker than trying to look through thousands of rows of a table.\n",

    "In the graph below, the \"LOCALE\" column from one of the college scorecard tables was quickly graphed using MS Excel. The plot shows row number as the horizontal axis, and a dot for each row of data. \n",

    "The graph produced isn't very helpful from a practical perspective, because whatever LOCALE means, it is obviously coded. \n",

    "A few things really jump out:\n",

    "* Values seem to be 10-14, 20-24, 30-34, and 40-44. There seems to be nothing between 15 and 20, 25 and 30, etc. The data is obviously coded, although you don't know what the code is yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are at least two negative values. These seem completely out of place given the rest of the data. A quick filter reveals that those 3 rows are for colleges in Palau, Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands. This quick sanity check gives you the opportunity to delete these rows if you want to exclude colleges outside the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are several values that are zeroes. Filtering the data to only show the zeroes reveals they are actually NULLs, and the graphing utility has interpreted them as zeroes for some reason. A quick scan across all the columns of these rows shows that all of the columns are filled with NULLs. These rows may be deleted, depending on the end goal, because they provide no useful new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this is just a quick peek at the manipulation necessary to perform any kind of meaningful data analysis. The data preparation step of the data science pipeline is where a lot of the work takes place.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of exploration doesn't take a lot of advanced education, but it does take practice. The best data scientists not only have strong analytical skills, but they have a thorough understanding of the data they are using, and strong knowledge about the processes from which they come.\n",

The left side of the pink box is labeled Q1, while the right side of the pink box is labeled Q3. In the middle of the box is a line labeled \"Median.\" The distance from Q1 to Q3 is labeled IQR.  Then a whisker extends to the right of the box, and there is a vertical line labeled Q3 + 1.5*IQR.  There are two green dots to the right of the whisker also.  From this top graphic, four grey lines extend down to a lower graphic, also contained in a box. These lines are located at the left vertical line, left side of the box, right side of the box, and right vertical line.  They drop to a corresponding normal distribution histogram, and you can see that the middle portion around zero sigma is the same pink as the box.  This portion of the histogram is labeled as 50%.  Then there is 24.65% on either side of the pink, shown in blue.  Lastly, the green portions are outside of the blue on either side and are labeled as .35% in the histogram.](Media/L09-39.png)\n",

The weight and MPG of each car is measured, and nearly impossible to interpret by looking at the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a scatterplot is created, in an instant the general relationship is obvious: each dot represents a single car, and heavier cars in general get lower gas mileage.\n",

    "* **Cons** : If line graphs are used inappropriately, they can be misleading. For example, some people will make a line graph when there is a quantitative variable on the y-axis, and a categorical variable on the x-axis.

    "# Tree Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree maps are highly visual methods of displaying data. They are hierarchical in that the categorical data has an element of drill down available in the graphic. This hierarchy is displayed using nested shapes, usually rectangles. Thousands of bits of information can be displayed in a single visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data format** : Tree maps have one quantitative variable and one or more categorical variables with multiple levels.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pros** : As noted before, thousands of rows of data can be conveyed in a single graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cons** : There is a lot of stuff to look at. It usually takes a bit more than just a cursory glance to catch all the nuance in the data. Sometimes small but important anomalies get lost in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A tree map in which the categorical variables are European countries and regions within each country. The size of the overall rectangles for each country, as well as the smaller rectangles for the regions within each country, are an indication of population. Color is an indication of the ration of elderly, considered sixty five and over, in the region.](Media/L09-35.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, take a look at this tree map above. The categorical variables are European country, and region within the country. The size of the overall rectangles for each country, as well as the smaller rectangles for the regions within each country, are an indication of population. Furthermore, color is an indication of the ratio of elderly (65 and over) in the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to see that Germany not only has a large population, but also has a large elderly population (assuming red is high, and blue is low, of course). France has a nice mix of older and younger, whereas Poland is largely a younger population than western European countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder why these data were not portrayed in a data map, since the groups are geographical regions. Good question! Take a look at both the area map and the tree map side-by-side, and see what is apparent in one graph but not the other:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are some observations:\n",

    "\n",
    "* Sweden is about 1.5 times the size of Germany geographically, but the population of Sweden is so small, that it is hard to find in the tree map. Germany has about 9 times the population of Sweden.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The UK and Ireland have a similar relationship. The UK is about 3 times the size of Ireland, but has about 15 times as many people. The impact of Ireland to the whole continent is overemphasized on the area graph, whereas on the tree map you can hardly find Ireland.\n",

    "## Heat Map\n",
    "\n",
    "Heat maps and tree maps are similar, in that they both use color and color gradients to display some sort of quantitative variable. Sometimes heat maps are symbolic representations of the data and simply use shapes (generally rectangles) to display different categories, while other times actual geographical maps are used to display things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heat maps became widely used in the early 1990s in the financial industry, and then spread out from there to many industries and sciences. Heat maps typically use colors ranging from bright green (for 'cool' regions) to bright red (for 'hot' regions), although it has become more common for heat maps to use the full spectrum of colors, where blue is the 'cool' color and red is the 'hot' color.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data format** : Heat maps usually have at least one quantitative variable that dictates the \"color\" of the region, depending on what the author defines as hot versus cool. If the heat map is rectangular generic shapes used to represent the category, then there is one or more categorical variables displayed (if it is two or more categorical variables, they usually have some sort of hierarchy).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pros** : The heat map shows lots of information at a glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cons** : The graphic can become insanely complex and need a lot of visual study to find the hidden gems.\n",

    "\n",
    "The heat map above is an indication of a company's annual sales. The size of each box represents the amount of sales in that area, and the color indicates the profitability of those sales. It is easy to see what is profitable, and what is not. A sales manager might make important decisions for future growth based on this chart alone.\n",

On the left, a map of the United Kingdom in August. Most of the map is green and yellow with only a few orange and red regions. On the right, a map of the United Kingdom in December.

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just a few of the available methods. There are thousands, and more are being created each day. Some are clever, some are way too much information, and some are rather dull. When determining what type or types of visualization should be included as you report results, keep the \"principle of parsimony\" in mind - use the simplest approach that gets your point across. Everything else is just clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Before any sort of statistical investigation of data takes place, it is a great idea to do a cursory scrub of the data, and to generate some simple visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The right visualization will help you learn about the data quickly and easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is a skill that becomes honed only through practice, but as a data scientist, you will be amazed at how easily you can knock your boss' socks off with a good visualization that tells a story quickly.\n",
