    "Suppose a botanical research firm employed you to monitor the growth of a particular species of bush that produces non-edible berries by collecting the weights of those berries.  You head out to the forest with several team members, armed with equipment to weigh berries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After the sampling plan has been determined, and precise instructions have been given, you head out to your assigned area to collect data.  Most of the berries you will measure today are between 70 and 130 milligrams (mg).  You begin to collect data and store it in a spreadsheet.  The first 20 rows look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![The first twenty rows of a spreadsheet, showing various weights in milligrams.](Media/L05-03.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the day, you busily weigh berries, as do the other members of your team.  By the end of the day, your team has weighed several thousand berries.  Rather than list out a huge table of numbers, someone decides to create a histogram of berry weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Histogram of berry weights. The x axis contains bins from 57.7 to 135.7.  The y axis contains weights from zero to five hundred.  The graph is labeled \"Berry Weights (mg)\" and it looks to be approximately normally distributed in a bell-shaped curve.](Media/L05-04.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest berry weighed in at 58.2 mg, and the largest weighed in at 135.5 mg.  The range was broken up into two mg increments (many people refer to these increments as buckets), and the data were grouped into those buckets.  Each vertical bar indicates how many berries fall into that bucket.  \n",
    "By the looks of the histogram, there aren't that many berries in the 57.7 to 59.7 bucket. In fact, the count is so small, that you can't even see it represented as a vertical bar.  Notice that the horizontal axis is only partially labeled, because putting all the labels in would have made it too crowded to read.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The vertical axis on the left indicates the height of each bar. For example, there is a bar labeled 89.7 to 91.7, and the height of the bar looks to be around 270.  This means there were 270 berries measured that fell into that weight bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of this graph is particularly important: it's shaped like a bell, and depicts the normal distribution.  Having been discovered by Gaussian, it is sometimes called \"Gaussian\" as well, so the normal distribution, the bell curve, or the Gaussian distribution all mean the same thing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that a great many things in nature exhibit a normal distribution.  It is so common that early statistics were developed around the normal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than collecting a bunch of data every time you want to discuss normal distributions, you can instead talk about them in general terms.  Below is a picture of a generic normal distribution.  Notice that there are no buckets, and the shape at the top has been smoothed to demonstrate the ideal shape.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a horizontal axis, with hash marks but no numbers attached, and there is no vertical axis, but the implication is that where the hump of the bell is taller, there is a greater concentration of numbers than where the hump is shorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A generic normal distribution with a classic bell curve shape.](Media/L05-05.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape implies that if you took an infinite number of measurements (you won't), it is a lot more likely that any single measurement will be closer to the center of the distribution than it will be out in the tails on either side.  The measurements that land near the center are common, the measurements that land in the tails are rare or unusual.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the distribution doesn't show it, the curved portion never really comes down to touch the horizontal axis...yes, that is correct, the tails go on forever to the left and to the right.  This shape of the data is often referred to as a \"distribution.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "If you look back at the histogram of berries, you can see that the bars are shorter in the 65 mg to 85 mg range, and also in the 115 mg to 135 mg range.  There are very few berries that were measured that fell into these weight ranges.  On the other hand, there are thousands of berries in the 90 mg to 110 mg range, as evidenced by the tall bars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of the normal distribution is iconic.  There are a vast number of natural and man-made phenomena that behave as normally distributed variables.  For this reason, most of the work in the early days of statistics was done using the normal distribution, and this is why it is so useful.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, there is so much known about the normal distribution, that even when a variable is not normally distributed, it is advantageous to either just treat it as though it were normal, or to somehow convert it to a normal shape.  \n",

For example, in this picture, you can see that the vertical lines representing \"mean +/- x standard deviations\" are drawn in.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the data in a normally distributed variable are within one standard deviation of the mean.  If you go out to +/- 2 standard deviations from the mean, you have captured most of the data in the distribution.

    "## Practical Usage of the Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, put the normal distribution into context.  Going back to the berries example above - note that it was stated that most of the berries that would be measured would be between 70 and 130 mg.  Interpret that as meaning that the mean of the distribution is 100 mg, and the standard deviation is 10 mg.  Now, look at the generic distribution from above, this time specifically related to the berries:\n",

    "![A normal distribution with mean and standard deviation lines for the weights of berries. The vertical line in the center represents one hundred milligrams. Running from left to right, the vertical lines represent seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred, one hundred ten, one hundred twenty, and one hundred thirty milligrams.](Media/L05-09.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you see how a lot of the berries are between 90 and 110, most are between 80 and 120, and virtually all are between 70 and 130?  This is the practical interpretation of the mean and standard deviation.  Later, you will learn how you can determine the probability of finding a berry in a certain weight range, and how rare it is to see an unusually large or unusually small berry.\n",

    "# The *z*-Score\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ghana, the height of a young adult woman is normally distributed, with a mean of 159.0 cm, and a standard deviation of about 4.9 cm.  Gabianu is a college student originally from Ghana, and she stands 169.0 cm tall.  She is on the tall side for Ghanian women.  \n",
    "\n",
    "She is 10 cm taller than the average woman, which is about 4 inches.  Gabinau is a little more than 2 standard deviations taller (2 x 4.9 = 9.8) than the average woman.  Now time to do a more precise calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![One hundred sixty nine point zero minus one hundred fifty nine point zero divided by four point nine equals ten divided by four point nine, approximately two point zero four standard deviations.](Media/L05-11.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, Gabianu is about 2.04 standard deviations taller than the average Ghanian woman.  Is that a lot?  Would you consider Gabianu to be extraordinarily tall or just a bit on the tall side?  \n",
    "\n",
    "A question like that is pretty subjective.  169 cm is about 5 feet 6 inches tall.  Rather than depend on a subjective declaration of Gabianu's stature, you could instead standardize her height.  That is exactly what you have done when calculated her height in terms of the standard deviation of the \"population\" of Ghanian women.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a name for this sort of standardization.  It is called a *z*-score.  A *z*-score is a great way to measure any individual piece of data relative to the population.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To calculate a *z*-score, you need to know a couple of things:\n",

    "-  Population mean\n",
    "-  Population standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though population parameters are technically unknown, you will often treat them as if they are known, because many calculations depend on knowing population parameters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Quite often, in an example or a quiz question, verbiage will be used to imply that the population parameters are known.  \n",

    "-  The baseline value of fat content in cheese\n",
    "-  The historical mean test score\n",
    "-  The agreed upon value for the speed of light\n",
    "-  The average lifespan of an incandescent light bulb\n",
    "\n",
    "Two globally accepted symbols represent the population mean and the population standard deviation.\n",

    "\n",
    "![The sigma symbol, which represents population standard deviation.](Media/L05-13.png)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![The formula for z score. Z equals x minus mu divided by sigma.](Media/L05-14.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, now examine the formula for a moment.  The numerator (that is the part of the fraction that is above the horizontal bar) of the *z*-score is simply the difference between your particular value (*x*) and the population mean.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if your value is larger than the mean, the numerator will be positive.  If your value is less than the mean, the numerator will be negative, which is okay.  Don't be tricked into thinking you should take the larger value and subtract the smaller value; you should always take your observed value, and subtract the population mean from it.  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### A *z*-Score Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the example with Gabianu, she is taller than the population mean, so the numerator for her *z*-score is 10 (169.0 - 159.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "With sigma in the denominator of the fraction, the difference (in the numerator) is simply getting scaled.  Gabianu's height difference from the mean is 10 cm.  When you divide that by 4.9 (which is the population standard deviation, or sigma), you are essentially converting the height difference of 10 cm and expressing it in terms of the sigma.  So ten divided by 4.9 is about 2.04, which means Gabianu's height is about 2.04 standard deviations more than the average height.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Gabianu's friend from Ghana is Rashida.  Rashida is 154.8 cm tall.  Calculate her *z*-score:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Z equals x minus mu divided by sigma equals one hundred four point eight minus one hundred fifty nine point zero divided by four point nine equals negative four point two divided by four point nine equals negative zero point eight six.](Media/L05-15.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Rashida has a *z*-score of -0.86, you interpret that as meaning she is about one standard deviation shorter than the average Ghanian woman.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, here is the *z*-score in layman's terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The *z*-score is a measure of how many standard deviations your value is away from the population mean.\n",

    "# *z*-scores in the Standard Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, now try and tie all of these concepts together.  Look at the Standard Normal Distribution again:\n",
    "\n",
    "![The standard normal distribution. A vertical line in the center represents a mean of zero. Vertical lines to the left and right of the mean represent a standard deviation of one.](Media/L05-10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, the mean for The Standard Normal Distribution is zero, and the standard deviation is 1.  If you plug these values into the *z*-score calculation, watch what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Z equals x minus zero divided by one equals x divided by one equals x.](Media/L05-16.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you catch that?  It turns out if you are looking for a z-score for a value of x and the distribution is The Standard Normal Distribution, then the z-score is equal to the input value, which is X.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if you calculate a z-score for *any* value in *any* normal distribution, what you have really done is map the value in its own distribution to the corresponding value in The Standard Normal Distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can use this to do cool things like calculate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that if you want to know the probability of a random value being in a certain range, it is equal to the area between the curve and the horizontal axis of the distribution from which the random value is taken.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the math easy, you can arbitrarily set the value of the area under the entire curve to 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Go back to the berry example.  The distribution of berry weights looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A normal distribution with mean and standard deviation lines for the weights of berries. The vertical line in the center represents one hundred milligrams. Running from left to right, the vertical lines represent seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred, one hundred ten, one hundred twenty, and one hundred thirty milligrams.](Media/L05-09.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose for some reason you wanted to know the probability of selecting a single berry at random, and having the weight of that berry be between 90 and 110 mg.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, you would like to figure out the area under the curve between 90 and 110, and compare that to the area under the whole curve:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A normal distribution with mean and standard deviation lines for the weights of berries. The vertical line in the center represents one hundred milligrams. Running from left to right, the vertical lines represent seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred, one hundred ten, one hundred twenty, and one hundred thirty milligrams. The portion of the distribution between ninety and one hundred ten is shaded.](Media/L05-17.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the area of the green shaded region, relative to the area under the entire curve (blue regions and green region combined)?  Remember, for simplicity, you arbitrarily set the area of the region under the entire curve to 1, just to make the math easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skipping the details, can you see how the *z*-score for 90 is -1, and the z-score for 110 is 1?  If you are struggling with this, remember that for the berries, mu = 100 and sigma = 10.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So knowing that, it looks like the probability of a single berry being between 90 and 110 is the same as the probability of a single *z*-score being between -1 and 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "![The standard normal distribution. A vertical line in the center represents a mean of zero. Vertical lines to the left and right of the mean represent a standard deviation of one. The portion of the distribution from negative one to one is shaded.](Media/L05-18.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the area under the curve is between -1 and 1 for The Standard Normal Distribution, this means the value is 0.683.  Therefore, the probability of a single berry being between 90 and 110 mg is the same as the probability of the *z*-score being between -1 and 1, which is the same as the area between -1 and 1 on The Standard Normal Distribution.  The answer is 0.683, or 68%.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unusual Events\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, the reason probability plays such a big role is because you want to be able to identify unusual events.  Events that are common just aren't that interesting, but unusual events can be very interesting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When an unusual event occurs, it is an indicator of one of two things - either you just witnessed something that doesn't happen that often, or whatever led you to believe it is an unusual event was wrong.  The first possibility can be exciting, but the second possibility can alter how you see the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example - in golf, a hole-in-one is a pretty rare event.  You are not talking about a hole-in-one at the mini golf course or at a pitch and putt, but about a hole-in-one on a regulation golf course that would be used by professionals.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![A man playing golf.](Media/L05-30.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the total population, the chances of making a hole-in-one are about 1 in 12,500.  Many people who routinely play golf go their entire lives without ever making or personally witnessing a hole-in-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of making a hole-in-one is 1/12,500 or about 0.00008.  In fact, because of the low probability that it happens, every time a hole-in-one is made, it is an exciting event.  But you wouldn't think anything was suspicious about an occasional hole-in-one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, other things might give you reason to wonder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 2016 Master's at Augusta, in the final round on Sunday, 3 different golfers made a hole-in-one on the same hole, and all 3 happened within about an hour.  To make it even more unusual, there were only 57 golfers playing that day, so 1 out of every 19 golfers hit a hole-in-one that day.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Any time there is a probability for an event of 0.05 or less, and the event occurs, it is considered to be a rare event.  When a rare event occurs, the first response of a data scientist is to question the validity of the assumptions in the system.  The truth of the matter is that sometimes, it is just a rare event that just happened to occur.\n",

    "Most statistics assume a normal distribution, so get used to that beautiful bell curve! The characteristics of the bell curve, particularly the probability of where a particular data point will fall (i.e. 1-3 standard deviations from the mean) is the basis for most hypothesis testing. In fact, the work you have learned today about finding *z*-scores in a wide variety of different settings is actually your very first, albeit it basic, hypothesis test, so congratulations!\n",
