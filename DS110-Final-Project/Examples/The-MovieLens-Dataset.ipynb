    "There are a number of datasets that are available for recommendation research. Amongst them, the [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/) dataset is probably one of the more popular ones. MovieLens is a non-commercial web-based movie recommender system. It is created in 1997 and run by GroupLens, a research lab at the University of Minnesota, in order to gather movie rating data for research purposes.  MovieLens data has been critical for several research studies including personalized recommendation and social psychology.\n",

    "The MovieLens dataset is hosted by the [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) website. Several versions are available. We will use the MovieLens 100K dataset :cite:`Herlocker.Konstan.Borchers.ea.1999`.  This dataset is comprised of $100,000$ ratings, ranging from 1 to 5 stars, from 943 users on 1682 movies. It has been cleaned up so that each user has rated at least 20 movies. Some simple demographic information such as age, gender, genres for the users and items are also available.  We can download the [ml-100k.zip](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip) and extract the `u.data` file, which contains all the $100,000$ ratings in the csv format. There are many other files in the folder, a detailed description for each file can be found in the [README](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k-README.txt) file of the dataset.\n",

    "We can see that each line consists of four columns, including \"user id\" 1-943, \"item id\" 1-1682, \"rating\" 1-5 and \"timestamp\". We can construct an interaction matrix of size $n \\times m$, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of users and the number of items respectively. This dataset only records the existing ratings, so we can also call it rating matrix and we will use interaction matrix and rating matrix interchangeably in case that the values of this matrix represent exact ratings. Most of the values in the rating matrix are unknown as users have not rated the majority of movies. We also show the sparsity of this dataset. The sparsity is defined as `1 - number of nonzero entries / ( number of users * number of items)`. Clearly, the interaction matrix is extremely sparse (i.e., sparsity = 93.695%). Real world datasets may suffer from a greater extent of sparsity and has been a long-standing challenge in building recommender systems. A viable solution is to use additional side information such as user/item features to alleviate the sparsity.\n",

In the `seq-aware` mode, we leave out the item that a user rated most recently for test, and users' historical interactions as training set.
