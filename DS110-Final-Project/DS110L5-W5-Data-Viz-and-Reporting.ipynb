    "\n",
    "Your presentation should take about 30 minutes, and then there will be 15 minutes for questions at the end.  Resist the urge to cram every single thing into your presentation; instead, hit the big \"Ah-ha\" moments.  You are likely to have LOTS of analyses that are inconclusive or uninteresting, so you don't need to include all of them. If employers are strongly interested in you, they'll check out your GitHub account and get all the details.  But including too much detail in an big picture overview presentation can make things boring and doesn't demonstrate you have summarization skills. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to demonstrate to your audience that analytics can improve decision making. Don't make them jump to conclusions on their own - walk them up to each and every important finding you want to highlight, and provide a summary of all graphs and findings that are one sentence or less and provided in plain English. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should be prepared to give a high level overview of your project, and your presentation should be divided into the following sections:\n",

In the results section, you will go over any of the exploratory findings you have you want discuss, as well as the answers to each evaluation question.  Ensure that you provide LOTS of beautiful visuals to go along with your findings. \n",

You will want to impress people with your visualizations, so put some time and effort into making them look nice!
