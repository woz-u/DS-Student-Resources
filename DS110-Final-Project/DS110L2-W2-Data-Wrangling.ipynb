    "Week 2 will be focused on wrangling your data and preparing it for analysis. Although it can be tempting to clean and prepare ALL your data, especially if you are someone that likes to be thorough, you are advised to focus only on the data that you need to clean up for your chosen analyses for your evaluatoin questions.  Otherwise, you may never graduate! Data wrangling is almost always the chunk of the data science pipeline that takes the longest, and if you were to wrangle your entire dataset, it could take months.  \n",
