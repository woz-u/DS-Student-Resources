    "\n",
    "First, define a project:\n",
    "\n",
    "*A project is temporary in that it has a defined beginning and end in time, and therefore defined scope and resources.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore Project Management is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "*The application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to produce activities to meet the project requirements.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, that is a pretty broad definition, but if you think for a moment, you will realize that projects are ubiquitous in your life, regardless of how well *managed* they might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Landscaping your yard\n",
    "* Planning a party\n",
    "* Remodeling your home\n",
    "\n",
    "In these types of scenarios, you often have full control, so you'd give the project some thought and then dive in. However, if you were paying someone to perform these tasks, you would require that they are organized, efficient, timely and thorough.  This is the task of project management.\n",

    "## What Is A Project Manager, Why Do You Need Them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Project managers are often tasked with the accountability for organizing a team and coordinating a project through to completion.  Successful Project Managers are organized individuals who can foster the respect of the team and possess strength in communication and resourcefulness.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key aspect of Project Management is **Risk Analysis**, in which the Project Manager strives to identify weaknesses in planning, or risks which may jeopardize the project timeline. When risks are identified, they should be discussed with the team and with stakeholders to determine the best course of action to *mitigate* the risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, while most are focused on leveraging skills to accomplish a specific task, the PM is focused on what could go *wrong* and ensuring that your team is prepared with an alternate plan.\n",

    "topic: Responsibilities of Project Management\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Responsibilities of Project Management\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "Scheduling and coordination of project resources are a core responsibility of Project Management to ensure that the project maintains its schedule. PMs will work with stakeholders and team members to coordinate and communicate the schedule, as well as adjustments to the schedule as they arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scope Management\n",
    "\n",
    "The *scope* of the project refers to the breadth of work to be done.  Frequently, people underestimate or overestimate the scope of a project.  This causes scope changes to be a frequent occurrence in the life of a PM. It is the PM's responsibility to manage and coordinate changes in scope to ensure that the outcome of the project is satisfactory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some scope adjustments are negotiable, such as a stakeholder requesting an additional feature. Others, however, are non-negotiable such as identifying a critical bug while working on a feature. The PM must negotiate and manage expectations within the team and stakeholders when scope changes occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "Project communication is essential to ensure that the team and stakeholders are both aware and comfortable with the progress and direction of the project.  The PM will typically produce reports at regular intervals to communicate progress and risks.  For many project management frameworks, the reporting structure is standardized to leverage common language and avoid confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Work Breakdown Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders often deal in very high-level requests (\"Let's build an email client\").  The PM is required to break these high-level terms down into all of the sub-tasks which must be completed to satisfy the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is called a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). A WBS is the process of starting with the desired outcome and working your way back to define 100% of the dependent tasks to deliver that outcome. This process produces a comprehensive scope of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "A WBS is neither a project plan, a schedule, nor a chronological listing. It specifies what will be done, not how or when.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Management Triangle\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Managers are accustomed to being asked to do more than is reasonable.  Stakeholders want projects completed faster and cheaper, while the quality of the project is always expected to be paramount. This puts Project Managers regularly under pressure to deliver more with less.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Project Management Triangle, also referred to as the Triple Constraint, or Iron Triangle is a diagram which emphasizes the give-and-take relationship between time, cost, and scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Project management triangle. It says Project management Triangle in the center and scope, time, and cost on the 3 sides.](media/triangle.png \"Project Management Triangle\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This illustration shows the relationship between the three primary constraints that affect the outcome of a project.  If a stakeholder desires an earlier delivery, the triangle would suggest that either scope must be cut or the cost will increase, or both.  Similarly, if the scope is increased, either the budget will need to increase, or the timeline must shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Triple-Constraint helps remind you of the impact of your decisions and provides a common language to discuss the repercussions.  However, the role of a Project manager is ultimately to find creative solutions, and therefore the triangle should serve as a guideline and not as a defense to avoid creative thought and critical problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Critical Path\n",
    "\n",
    "The Critical Path is a key element to managing and optimizing traditional Waterfall projects.  The Critical Path is the sequence of tasks which conclude at the *end* of the timeline.  This is the focus of the project manager to ensure you don't slip on this timeline.  Consider the following Diagram of tasks and time to complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Schematic for a critical path for a 4 day project. It starts with day 1. It them follows one of 2 routes. It goes to one day, then two days, then finish. It also goes from one day direct to finish or from one day to two days to one day to finish.](media/critical.png \"Critical Path\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this is a 4-day project, wherein the top sequence of tasks complete in 3 days, yet the bottom (critical) path requires four days.  Since the project is dependent on all tasks being completed, the entire project is on a 4-day timeline.  The critical path is the sequence of tasks which limit the project timeline from being reduced.  In other words, any extension of the tasks on the critical path will also extend the project deadline.\n",

    "\n",
    "Traditional project management, also referred to as **Waterfall**, is the most natural to use.  This is the way you probably visualize your landscaping project, as a sequence of tasks each dependent on the prior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lean\n",
    "\n",
    "Lean Project Management finds its roots in Lean Manufacturing which is a process pioneered by Taiichi Ohno during his time as an industrial engineer with Toyota in the 1940s. The main principles behind Lean are to reduce waste and establish a continuous chain of production.  This method is often referred to as **Just-in-Time** production.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agile\n",
    "\n",
    "Agile Project Management builds upon the foundation established by Lean and is viewed as its software-related counterpart.  The main principle of **Agile Project Management** is incremental delivery and feedback from customers.  It is an expansion on the Just-in-Time (JIT) principle of Lean. Incremental delivery principles can be traced back to the late 1950's. However, Agile gained tremendous favor with the software community in the early 2000s with the formalization of the Agile Manifesto: a document outlining the goals (not the processes) of Agile software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### PMI\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Project Management Institute (PMI)** is traditionally regarded as the primary source of knowledge and standards in regards to traditional Project Management.  Their Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) is a book which outlines the recommended best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "PMI draws its project management knowledge from 10 areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Integration\n",
    "* Scope\n",
    "* Time\n",
    "* Cost\n",
    "* Quality\n",
    "* Procurement\n",
    "* Human resources\n",
    "* Communications\n",
    "* Risk management\n",
    "* Stakeholder management\n",
    "\n",
    "That is to say that when managing a project, PMI asserts that these ten elements, and balancing them to a positive outcome are of primary concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "PMI is an excellent source of knowledge; however, many Agile evangelists assert that the PMI's methods are too far rooted in traditional waterfall methods.  This is a reputation that PMI is changing with more recent certifications such as PMI-ACP (Project Management Institute Certified Agile Practitioner).\n",

    "At this point you have undoubtedly realized the challenges of planning in software.  It is challenging to predict and project all requirements and provide sufficient detail to ensure that the result meets expectations.  Ultimately, every time you attempt up-front planning, you are inevitably wrong; you either overestimate or underestimate efforts.  Project Managers have become conditioned to building *buffers* into their timelines to account for unforeseen risk.  In the late 90's many companies began challenging the planning process and looking for a better solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Delivery Lag\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mid-90's, industry experts asserted that the average delivery time of a non-trivial software product was **3 years**.  So think back to your business requirements from the previous Hands-On.  What if you didn't receive the resulting product for another three years?  Think about the lost opportunities, the changing marketplace, how do you adapt to beat your competitors?\n",
    "\n",
    "This delay between the identification of a product need, and the delivery of a software solution is referred to as Application Delivery lag.  This was one of the primary drivers for software professionals to pursue a better way of managing their teams.  How can you deliver value to the customer faster, and adapt more quickly to changing requirements?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The 80/20 Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "When you perform significant, up-front planning to your projects, you'd often misjudge the customer's needs.  The 80/20 rule states that 80% of the value in your software comes from 20% of the effort.  To explore this concept let's take an example: *Microsoft Excel*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft Excel is an incredibly valuable product with many sophisticated features.  If you wanted to create a competing product for Excel, it would take years to capture the decades worth of functionality that has been included in the system.  Creating a 10-year timeline to recreate the functionality of Excel would probably not be a great strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, if you were to consider the most *valuable* functionality, you may come up with a top 3 list like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* User can enter values in cells\n",
    "* User can perform basic math functions\n",
    "* User can create pie charts from cell data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the most commonly used and valuable features of Excel but certainly wouldn't take you years to complete. You could offer these features, as immediate value to customers within a few weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, many of the features in Excel, which took years to develop, are rarely used.  For example, the ability to write a function to determine if a cell contains a value *is* useful, but your users may prefer to not wait for a for that functionality before they get access to the top-3 above.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you built the most commonly used features first, and delivered those to your users before determining the next most valuable feature?  This iterative approach is at the core of Agile Development.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Birth of Agile\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2001, a group of 16 software leaders attended a summit in Snowbird Utah to explore better ways of developing software.  This group included Jon Kern, Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham, Arie van Bennekum, Alistair Cockburn, and eleven others, all well known today in the agile community.\n",
    "\n",
    "This group of thought leaders set out to determine a process which will enable developers to get functionality into the hands of its users quickly and gather feedback.  This way you would avoid the common pitfalls of significant, up-front planning or making incorrect assumptions of what the user wants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of their conversation was rooted in how to improve upon the traditional waterfall method and overcome its pitfalls.  This now-famous encounter in Snowbird resulted in a document title the **Agile Manifesto**, which succinctly captures the principles set forth by the group.  The manifesto is not an opinionated *process* but rather a statement of principles which enable development teams to welcome change with open arms instead of combating it and producing poor outcomes.\n",

    "## Twelve Principles of Agile Software Development\n",
    "\n",
    "You should follow these principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your highest priority is to satisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of valuable software.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is a face-to-face conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many teams actively pursue these twelve principles through a variety of well-documented implementations of Agile.  Keep in mind that although 2001 seems like a long time ago, you are still discovering better strategies for achieving these principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, understanding these foundational principles is much more important than understanding the rapidly changing implementations that you will cover in the coming chapters.  To be an Agile software developer is to know and live these principles.\n",

    "# Waterfall Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "When you think about a project, you typically break it down into steps and sequentially perform those steps. This is the most natural and obvious approach to managing a project and tends to be familiar to most people. This non-iterative process of completing your work in phases is referred to as the Waterfall method due to the way the progress _flows_ from one stage to the next. In this lesson, you will learn about the most common traditional method for managing projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Waterfall methodology was initially defined by Winston W. Royce in 1970. The Waterfall Methodology is a natural approach to project management, and as such, it quickly became the norm as it was easy for all involved parties to comprehend. The premise of the waterfall method is that progress flows from stage to stage, each phase being dependent on completion of the previous stage. The specific implementation, or stages, of the process, differ significantly; however the notion of a sequential process is prevalent throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram illustrates a typical Waterfall approach to the Software Development Lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Waterfall Method**:\n",
    "\n",
    "![The waterfall method. Schematic showing stacked boxes with arrows connecting them. In order from top down, the boxes say Requirements (product requirements document), Design (software architecture), Implementation (software), verification, and maintenance.](media/waterfall.png 'Waterfall')\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the waterfall-style flow of progress in this sequence of activities. Because there is no overlap (by design), each phase is dependent on thorough completion of the prior phase. The Waterfall method makes the assumption that all requirements can be gathered up front and thoroughly documented. This process is often well-received by stakeholders since it puts design in control of the process, and the business teams are forced to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the requirements up front. Once the requirements phase is complete, the control flows 'downhill'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **Design** phase is dedicated to the in-depth documentation of architectural specifications, and user-interface designs as well as hardware specifications where applicable. The goal of this phase is to produce design documentation which can be turned over for implementation potentially by a separate team. Architects and designers negotiate the best approach to satisfying the business requirements and often cycle back and forth revising scope and approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **Implementation** phase is when all of the actual development takes place. This phase belongs to the programmers in the Waterfall method, as they take the project requirements and specifications, and code the applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **Verification** phase is dedicated to a series of quality assurance tests to validate that the application is working as designed and that all requirements have been met. This phase is often conducted by a separate QA team, who also has an interest in producing thorough documentation of the testing process and test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* During the **Maintenance** phase, the customer is using the developed application. As problems are found due to improper requirements determination or other mistakes in the design process, or due to changes in the users' requirements, changes are made to the system during this phase.\n",
