    "Scrum has quickly surfaced as the most widely adopted agile framework.  Scrum emphasizes an iterative approach to development, which fosters feedback and welcomes change requests.  Scrum defines an evidence-based, empirical approach to creating products in which expectations are set based on proven performance not estimates timelines.  Scrum requires a radical change in thinking from traditional project management but can produce better outcomes when applied in the right situations."

    "# History\n",
    "\n",
    "The origins of Scrum began in the wake of the Lean product management movement at Toyota in the late '80s.  In a 1986 article titled \"[The New New Product Development Game](https://hbr.org/1986/01/the-new-new-product-development-game)\", Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka introduced the first notions of what would ultimately be referred to as the Scrum process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental principle that was defined in that article was the notion of the team working together as a singular unit from inception to completion.  The intent was that this approach of avoiding siloed teams would avoid poor communication and reduce wasted time and resources in the process.  This is where the term Scrum took form, based on the author's observations of Rugby teams, and how they would huddle or 'scrum' together to move the ball down the field as a cohesive unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early '90s, software leaders Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland each implemented variations of what would become the Scrum process while at separate companies.  Realizing the similarities in their approaches, they joined forces to present and promote the effectiveness of the Scrum process at Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications (OOPSLA) in Austin, Texas in 1995. Over the following years, they continued to collaborate to fine-tune the standards and benefits of using Scrum while evangelizing its benefits to achieve the widespread adoption it enjoys today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sutherland continued to author the best-selling book \"Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Schwaber went on to author \"Agile Software Development with Scrum\" as well as founding the Scrum Alliance and [scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Three Pillars of Scrum\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrum, at its core, is a framework designed to improve continuously.  Three primary principles support this foundational goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "All work within the Scrum framework should be visible to those responsible for the outcome: the process, the workflow, progress, etc.  By building transparency in the process, the team can objectively and openly discuss improvement.  Without transparency, Scrum teams struggle to find effective methods for improvement.  This is often one of the most challenging aspects since it's human nature to avoid sharing your mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "To make these things visible, Scrum Teams need to frequently inspect the product being developed and how well the team is working.  The team will often hold regularly scheduled time to review what has gone well and what needs improving.  If the team doesn't plan for this as a regular ceremony, then frequently the team will get too wrapped up in their work to identify ways to accelerate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "With frequent inspection, the team can spot when their work deviates outside of acceptable limits and adapt their process or the product under development.  The process of adapting and improving is one of experimentation and discovery.  Scrum teams, through transparency and inspection, are armed with metrics and evidence that articulate their performance.  The high-performing scrum team will always look for a means to improve upon historical performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Five Objectives of a Scrum Team\n",
    "\n",
    "With transparency at the core of the Scrum framework, its crucial that the team builds trust and an ability to share, critique and constructively challenge each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Openness:** Team members and their stakeholders agree to be transparent about their work and any challenges they face.\n",
    "* **Respect:** Team members respect each other to be technically capable and to work with good intent.\n",
    "* **Focus:** Team members focus solely on their team goals and the Sprint Backlog.  This reduces the chances for distraction or sub-optimized efforts.\n",
    "* **Commitment:** Team members individually commit to achieving their team goals every Sprint.\n",
    "* **Courage:** Team members develop the courage to work through conflict and challenges together so that they can do the right thing for the project.\n",

    "# Scrum Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scrum framework calls for a very specific set of Roles which are often unfamiliar to newcomers.  The structure of a Scrum team is that of a cross-functional group of people who share a common goal and operate in unison supporting each other towards shared goals.  Below, you will explore the roles of the Scrum team.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scrum Master\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scrum Master is the facilitator of the Scrum process.  The role of the Scrum Master is to ensure that the team implements the Scrum process wholly and accurately.  The Scrum Master is often confused with a traditional Project Manager; however the Scrum Master is more focused on guarding the team against external distraction instead of leading the team.  The Scrum Master also does not typically have personnel management responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing impediments is the primary focus of the Scrum Master, hearing the feedback from the team, and identifying ways to remove challenges and enable the team to succeed.  The Scrum Master is typically the person who schedules and initiates the ceremonies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Responsibilities of the Scrum Master include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scheduling and Facilitating ceremonies\n",
    "* Training newcomers on the Scrum process\n",
    "* Removing impediments from the team, allowing them to focus\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Product Owner\n",
    "\n",
    "The Product Owner is the domain expert and voice of the customer.  They are the most qualified person to represent the needs of the customer or stakeholders and keep the team focused on tasks which are attainable and highly valued.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Product Owner's primary goal is to ensure that the Product Backlog (To-Do list) is always current and prioritized with the most valued items towards the top.  With a properly groomed backlog, the team will always have perspective on what the most desired features are and maximize their efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Customer and Stakeholder ambassador to the Scrum team, the Product Owner will rely on excellent communication skills both within the team and when communicating progress externally.  Much like how the Scrum Master shields the team from distractions, the Product Owner is dedicated to handling nearly all communication and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical responsibilities of the Product Owner include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creating User Stories (tasks) for the team\n",
    "* Prioritizing the backlog\n",
    "* Communicating progress, and scheduling releases\n",
    "* Demonstrates the product\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Development Team\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining members of the team, outside of the Product Owner and the Scrum master, are referred to as the Development Team.  These members are cross-functional and self-organizing.  That is to say that the Development Team handles all responsibilities from analysis, design, development, testing, deployment and otherwise.  Additionally, the team does not have an interest in further distinguishing roles, they are self-organizing, which is to say that there is no centralized authority but rather a shared commitment to becoming a high performing team.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Size of a Scrum Team\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended size of a Scrum team is 5 to 11 members.  With the Scrum Master and the Product Owner being required staples of the team, having less than five members would mean only two people are involved in development.  Having more than 11 would introduce concerns about the team not being agile enough since there are so many people involved.  Daily standup meetings become extended, and sprints (small incremental deadlines) become challenging to plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## But Who is in Charge?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major challenges that newcomers face is concern over who is in charge.  The concept of Scrum being self-organizing is unlike most situations you've encountered.  You have become accustomed to your boss telling you \"I need this feature completed by next Monday.\"  In Scrum, that accountability is shared by the team, and there is no centralized authority.  This requires the team to hold each other accountable, both supporting and challenging each other to perform at their best.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no hierarchy in Scrum.  It's common that new members look towards the Scrum Master or the Product Owner as the *leader*, when in fact they hold the same level of influence, they bring a different set of skills and responsibilities.\n",

    "Recall back to the Agile Manifesto, that you value Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools.  However, you also are implementing a management framework in which you are pursuing constant improvement.  So you'd have a goal of determining metrics to guide your improvement strategies, without burdening the team with additional processes and tooling.  Scrum artifacts provide just that: minimal and lightweight metrics and reporting to inform the team of their productivity, without slowing the team down.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Stories\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid miscommunication, Scrum describes a standard format for documenting a task.  User Stories are tasks which are written from the perspective of the user.  This format aids the team in quickly understanding what the intent of the request is and who it benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical User Story follows this format:\n",
    "\"As a ___ I need ___ to ___ \"\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Story**\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a user, I need a tooltip describing what a *post* is\n",
    "* As a user, I need to be able to create a post to share my opinion with the world\n",
    "* As an administrator, I need to be able to remove posts which would endanger another user\n",
    "* As a cashier, I need to be able to swipe a credit card for payment\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging this consistent format, the team can see the desired functionality and the scope of the requests from a user's perspective.  This helps you to capture the value that you are offering the customer and focus on delivering it quickly and accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The product owner may also include *acceptance criteria* in the description of the User Story to indicate some of the more subtle details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Story**\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"As an administrator, I need to be able to remove posts which would endanger another user.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    *  should not be accessible by standard users\n",
    "    *  should prompt the user for confirmation on deleting a post\n",
    "    *  should offer a link to suspend an account for repeat offenders\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Story Points\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimating the time to complete a development task has always been challenging.  A request that takes you 4 hours may take another developer 16 hours, and it is incredibly common to overestimate or underestimate technical work grossly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrum recognizes this and offers an alternative in the form of Story Points.  Story Points are a means for you to describe the complexity of the work to be done, without relating it to working hours, which has proven to be a highly inaccurate way of setting expectations for completion.  Scrum best practices call for you to assign each story some points which are intended to describe the **relative complexity** of the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand relative complexity, time to look at an example.  For the moment, assume that your options for points (complexity) are: 1,2,3,5,8,13... You will learn more on this later.\n",

It's more complicated than your Tooltip with a value of 1, and you've determined that it's slightly less complex than creating a post with a value of 8.

As an empirical process, Scrum looks historically at the team's performance when setting reasonable expectations.  That is to say that if the team is averaging 80 story points per sprint, the team would typically feel comfortable committing to 70-90 points in the coming sprint.

    "\n",
    "When you are involved in a paired programming session, you and one other person are collaborating on the same task.  Typically, you and your partner will fulfill 2 roles; the *driver* and the *observer*, the roles should be rotated at regular intervals.  The goal is not to divide and conquer your work, but instead to have multiple opinions and productive dialog around the design decisions being made.  You can think of pair programming as inline code reviewing as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a physical setting, the observer will sit alongside the driver, discussing the approach, identifying mistakes, and ensuring a collectively agreed upon design.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a remote setting, your session should be performed on a video conference.  Encourage your team to utilize video instead of a disengaged experience where one member is wondering if the other is present.\n",

    "Here's how to get started:\n",
    "* Schedule a regular time to perform a pair programing session.  Oftentimes this session will span hours, just as your tasks do.\n",
    "* Determine who will drive and who will observe for this session.  Do not break the driver/observer relationship until you reach a good stopping point.\n",
    "* The Driver will need to be conscious about sharing his/her thought process while driving, so that the observer has context to what the driver is attempting to accomplish.\n",
    "* The observer should feel equally responsible for the resulting solution, therefore, be open and opinionated about their preferred approach.\n",
    "* Recognize this process will be foreign at first, but soon you will see the benefits to your code!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few example discussion topics during a pair programming session:\n",
    "* What are we trying to accomplish?\n",
    "* How do you think we should solve the given problem?\n",
    "* What impact will this code have on other dependencies within our system?\n",
    "* How legible/comprehensible is the code we are writing?\n",
    "* What upcoming requirements will have a bearing on this feature, and how do we design to account for that?\n",

    "## Why Pair Program\n",

    "The most prominent reasons for  you to engage in pair programing are for you to improve the *quality* of your code, and develop the skills among your team.  Let's take a deeper look:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improve Code Quality\n",
    "* Pair Programmed solutions incorporate multiple viewpoints and experiences, producing a more well-rounded solution.\n",
    "* Pair Programming reduces the liklihood a contributor 'slips' an incomplete solution into the codebase without review.\n",
    "* Pair Programming is early to intercept poor stylistic choices, as the observer will struggle to understand the code as it's being written, instead of after it has been in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Develop Skills\n",
    "* Pairing your veterans with newcomers can be an incredible learning opportunity, be sure to have the newcomer serve initially as the *driver* to avoid disengagement.\n",
    "* Pair programming allows you to experience how other contributors work.  Subtle advantages, like keyboard shortcuts, debugging techniques and other efficiency techniques are discussed, which is typically overlooked during a code review.\n",
    "* Communication is improved upon by making pair programming part of your regular workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Downsides to Pair Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary downside to pair programming is the increase in man-hours required to accomplish a task since two people are working together.  However, do not accept this downside at face-value, also be sure to consider that coder reviews *should* be part of your workflow, and by pair programming, the Code Review has been processed, so you can save that time.  Also be sure to consider the avoidance of defects which comes with multiple people reviewing the code.  Lastly, be sure to consider the investment in developing your team's skills by sharing and collaborating on solutions.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have now become aware, the Scrum process is pretty opinionated with specific standards right down to the recommended values for story pointing. Many teams set out to implement Scrum, yet land somewhere in-between true Scrum and a classic waterfall approach. Perhaps you hold daily stand-ups and schedule sprints, but don't have a clear DoD, or close out sprints without actually releasing your PSI. It is easy to fall back on methods that feel more natural to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are learning Scrum or evaluating the effectiveness of its methods, be sure to implement Scrum in its entirety for a true sense of its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is natural to think of estimating your tasks in terms of hours. The notion of working hours is much more familiar than an arbitrary scale indicating relative complexity of tasks. It's even harder to describe it to someone. The fact of the matter is, the hours are inevitably a misrepresentation of the actual work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skill levels and experiences vary so considerably between developers that the notion of a 4-hour task is pretty meaningless. Besides, tracking hours often rewards bad behaviors. When confronted with a 20-hour task that can be completed in 10-hours, people will often leverage the remaining time to work on something that is in their interest, and not the interest of the team. Even with the best of intentions, a good developer may take that _extra_ time to clean up some poorly written code or reduce some technical debt. Although those efforts have value, the _transparency_ among the team is lost.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stakeholder Buy-in\n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders are often traditionalists who are comfortable in methods that they in which have experience. Questions like \"When will a feature be done?\" or \"How many hours did you spend on that feature?\" are comforting. There is an inherent leap of faith in the notion that Scrum, with its reduced documentation and constant improvement, will produce better results than a _well thought out plan_. The myth is in the fact that even _well thought out plans_ are nearly always wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders begin to buy into the process when they see the rapid delivery of functional software. Scrum is designed to make them an active influencer in the product and offer them more control than traditional methods. Phrases like; \"If that's what you need, I can start it next week\" are in stark comparison to \"I don't have room in the schedule.\"\n",

    "Leveraging what you've learned about the Scrum method, you will be required to Populate a Product Backlog with User Stories. This exercise will give you practice with authoring User Stories and expose you to the challenges of the Product Owner. You will then plan your first sprint, an exercise that the Scrum Master would facilitate. Through the planning process, you will be required to provide Story Points for each of the User Stories that you have created. Meet the below requirements:\n",

    "* **Create a Scrum Board:** Add 4 Lists:\n",

    "    -  In-Progress\n",
    "    -  Done\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Groom your Backlog:** Reorder the stories by priority with the most urgent stories up top.  Consider the value to the customer, and ensure that the most valuable stories are at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Add Story Points:** Once you have your 20 User stories written, you will need to switch gears from Product Owner to Development Team.  Go back through each story and prepend the story point value to the title like this: \"[8] As a ____, I need ____ to ____\".  Be sure to follow the Fibonacci sequence when pointing your stories, and if a story ends up larger than a 13, break it down into smaller stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Plan a Sprint:** Lastly, assume your scrum team has a historical velocity of 36 points per sprint. Plan out your next sprint by moving the appropriate cards into the *To-Do* list.  Your To-Do list should contain stories that are designed as Potentially Shippable Increments(PSI).\n",
