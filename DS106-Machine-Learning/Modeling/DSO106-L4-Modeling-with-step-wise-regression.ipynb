    "As a data scientist, regularly you will likely be faced with a large dataset and a request by the process owner to \"make sense of the data.\" This is a daunting task. One of the approaches to solving a problem such as this is to employ a technique called *stepwise regression*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have learned in previous lessons about linear regression, logistic regression, and non-linear regression. In each case, you had a single response variable, and a single predictor variable with which you created a model. Well, you're hitting the big-time now, because now you're adding additional predictors! As many as your data allows! Just adding them in is the concept of *multiple regression*.  But if you want to sort out which ones are most important, than you'll need to employ *stepwise regression*. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand multiple regression\n",
    "* Differentiate between the three different types of stepwise regression\n",
    "* Complete backwards elimination, forward selection, and hybrid stepwise regression in R\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will culminate in a hands-on in which you determine the best linear regression model through stepwise regression in R.\n",

    "# Stepwise Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "*Stepwise regression* is a method of fitting regression models in which the choice of predictive variables is carried out by an automatic procedure. In each step, a predictor variable is considered for addition to or subtraction from the set of explanatory variables based on some pre-specified criterion. Usually, this takes the form of a sequence of *F*-tests or *t*-tests. Stepwise regression is a tool that can help determine a complex relationship. Modeling is an iterative process, and stepwise regression certainly has a seat at the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"stepwise\" comes from the fact that the process is iterative. Each time a term is eliminated, the remaining model is re-evaluated. This is in contrast to determining multiple terms that can be eliminated on the initial observation. The phrase \"...in the presence of the other terms\" is important here, because each term individually will behave differently depending on what other terms are in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a dataset that includes a single response variable, and 6 different possible predictor variables. How do you figure out what the best model is? One approach would be to look at all possible models, and simply choosing the best one based on an r<sup>2</sup> value. Seems reasonable, right? The higher the r<sup>2</sup> value is, the more predicting power the model has - at least, that is the theory. However, this approach has a couple of weaknesses that makes it less than ideal: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **This becomes a lot of models very quickly!** The number of possible models is two raised to the power of your predictors: 2<sup>x</sup>. In the case of 6 predictor variables, that would be 2<sup>6</sup> models, or 64 models. You could take the time to look through 64 models to determine which one is best, but it will be very tedious. And that's not even including any interactions between your variables or any terms for non-linear modeling. Can you imagine what would happen if there were 30 predictor variables? That would give 2<sup>30</sup> possible models, but 2<sup>30</sup> ~ 1.07 billion models. You and all your friends could spend 1000 lifetimes looking over the models and doing nothing else, and you would still never find the best one!\n",
    "\n",
    "* **R<sup>2</sup> will never decrease:** As you add predictor terms to a model, R<sup>2</sup> may stay the same, or it might increase, but it will never decrease. In other words, the model that contains **all** of the predictor variables will have the highest r<sup>2</sup> value. If that is your only criteria for determining which model is best, then you would automatically have to use the model that contains all predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder what is wrong with including all the predictor variables. Well, using all of the predictor variables increases the chances of *overfitting* the model. Basically, the model fits your current data so well that it won't fit similar data later. It can't be generalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a thing called the *Principle of Parsimony* in science. It is applied to many branches of science, and in a nutshell, it means that the most acceptable explanation of any phenomenon is usually the simplest explanation. That is not to say that there are no complex solutions to science problems; there certainly are. The more accurate interpretation is that if there are two \"equally\" good models for a particular relationship, whichever is simpler is usually the preferred model.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Approaches for Stepwise Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "So now that you know what doesn't work, what does? Stepwise regression, of course! There are three different approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Backward Elimination\n",
    "2. Forward Selection\n",
    "3. Hybrid\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn about all three in this lesson, with the help of the organization \"Dragonfly Statistics\" and their tutorial videos.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Backward Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with all the predictors, and then start eliminating one variable at a time, starting with the IV that has the least effect on improving the model. Keep removing terms until the point at which removing a term has a significant detrimental effect on the model, and then stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you wanted to create a model to predict someone's weight. You all have a pretty good understanding of what contributes to someone's weight. For example, you can all pretty much agree a person's height, gender, body type, body fat percentage, etc. all could help predict a person's weight. Some of those might be better predictors than others, but they all probably have some sort of prediction ability. On the other hand, you might know stuff about a person that probably has little or nothing to do with a person's weight, such as their IQ, the number of cousins they have, or whether or not they like rodeo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone who is an expert on heights of humans might be able to toss out the meaningless predictors, state the predictors that are completely meaningful, and even weight the predictors that are marginal. But for the rest of you, how would you know? Using the technique of backward elimination would create a model with all of the predictors in the model, and then it would determine (one at a time) which terms don't belong, based on criteria you will discuss later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general approach is that if a single predictor - in the presence of all other predictors - does not add to the quality of the model, then it is dropped. Each time a predictor is dropped, the new model is evaluated to determine if there is another predictor can be dropped. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Forward Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with the single predictor that has the greatest prediction power in the model, and then add predictors one at a time, beginning with the remaining predictor that has the greatest prediction power in the presence of all the terms already included in the model. Once you get to a point where adding an additional term has little effect in improving the predictability of the model, stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Hybrid: Combining Forward Selection and Backward Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "This method combines the first two methods. At each step, the method determines if a term needs to be added, and if any of the terms previously added need to be eliminated.\n",

Well, yes - if the ```qsec``` is larger, that means the car is slower off the start. If you know anything about cars, more power is usually associated with more speed, which is usually associated with worse gas mileage. In this case, you are being told that less power leads to higher gas mileage - for every additional second it takes to run a quarter mile, the gas mileage is improved by about 1.2 miles per gallon. It is pretty much an accepted fact that gutless cars get better gas mileage than fast cars.\n",

However, did you notice the terms in the predictor model are not the same? That is actually a pretty common result.
