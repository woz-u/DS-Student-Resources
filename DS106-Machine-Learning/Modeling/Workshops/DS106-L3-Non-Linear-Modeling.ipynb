In fact, the noise scale is exponential both in intensity, and 'loudness.' For instance, a sound at 40 dB would be quiet talking, whereas a sound at 50 dB (louder conversation) would be 10 times as intense, and twice as loud.\n",

Again starting at 40 dB, a change to 80 dB (loud highway noise at close range) is change of intensity of 10,000x, and a change in loudness of 16x. An 80 dB sound is much more than just twice the intensity or loudness of a 40 dB sound. Take a look:\n",

A whisper at two meters, twenty. A quote silent unquote library, thirty, and so on, up to fireworks at one meter, one hundred fifty. To the right of the scale are how these situations will sound to a person, ranging from faint at thirty decibles to intolerable at one hundred fifty decibles to loudest possible true sound at one hundred ninety decibles.](Media/L03-10.png)\n",

    "## Richter Scale Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common measurement that is also exponential is the Richter scale, which measures magnitude of an earthquake. The scale goes from 1 to 9, but each increase of 1 on the Richter scale translates to an earthquake that has a shaking amplitude that is 10 times higher, and the energy released is 31.6 times as high. A magnitude 5 earthquake is usually felt by those at the epicenter, but the damage is usually minimal unless the buildings are poorly constructed. They rarely get reported unless they are felt in heavily populated areas. On average, there are usually 3 to 5 of these earthquakes every day. On the other hand, a magnitude 6 earthquake can usually be felt up to a couple hundred miles from the epicenter, and damage will vary depending on the quality of the construction at the epicenter. However, they still happen at least a couple times a week. \n",
    "\n",
    "An earthquake that measures 7 on the Richter scale is considered to be a major quake. Buildings at the center will suffer major damage to complete collapse, and buildings as much as 150 miles away will have some damage. These occur 1 - 2 times per month. At 8, an earthquake causes major damage to total destruction to even the most sturdy structures at the epicenter, and damage will be widespread. These can be felt several hundred miles away. You get about one of these each year. An earthquake that measures 9 or more on the Richter scale will happen once every 10 to 20 years, usually causes total destruction at the epicenter, and can cause permanent changes in the local topography. The most recent earthquake 9 or higher was in Japan in 2011. Prior to that was the earthquake is Sumatra on the day after Christmas in 2004 (9.1 on the Richter scale); the tsunami that followed killed nearly a quarter of a million people. Prior to these two, the last earthquake of magnitude 9 or higher was way back in the 1960's.\n",

You have two sets of X and Y variables here; graph and analyze both and determine what non-linear form they best follow.  These two sets of X and Ys might both be exponential relationships or quadratic relationships, or there might be one of each. The best way to figure it out is to try and fit both a quadratic function and an exponential function to each pair of variables, and then model each to determine which model is a better fit. \n",

    "2.  Using eyeball analysis, make a guess about what type of model will work best for the dataset. You can add the best fit quadratic line as well to determine if it's a good fit.\n",
