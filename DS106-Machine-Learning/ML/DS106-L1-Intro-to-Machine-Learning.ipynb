    "# What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer scientist by the name of Arthur Samuel pioneered the term \"machine learning.\" Here is how he defines machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "> _\"[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\"_ - Arthur Samuel, 1959\n",
    "\n",
    "The key portion of that phrase is _\"without being explicitly programmed\"_. How is machine learning different from systems that have been explicitly programmed? Fundamentally, explicitly programmed systems involves writing code that solves a set of known problem in discrete steps. In fact, some problems can't be solved as efficiently by explicitly being programmed. How is this possible? Consider for one moment how a developer would go about filtering out spam email from the \"ham\" emails (good email).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following _pseudocode_, or high-level code, demonstrates how a programmer would explicitly filter out spam emails:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "spam_phrases = [\"FREE!!\", \"Black Friday Sale!\", \"Dear Sir, I hope this email finds you well. Wire me money.\"]\n",
    "If (email contains phrases from spam_phrases)\n",
    "    Flag email as spam\n",
    "    Send email to \"Spam\" folder\n",
    "Otherwise\n",
    "    Keep email in the inbox\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"panel panel-success\">\n",
    "    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n",
    "        <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Fun fact!</h3>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n",
    "        <p>One of the first mainstream applications of machine learning was used to filter out spam emails</a>in the 1990s.</p>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This might seem relatively straight-forward. If the email contains any of the spam phrases, mark it as spam and place it in the spam folder. However, this is not optimal for many reasons. For one, imagine what would happen to an email sent from a friend or family member warning them about malicious spam emails: _\"Don't click those 'Black Friday Sale!' emails. It downloads a virus.\"_ According the rules setup, this email will be flagged as spam even though it's not. One reaction might be to add the sender's email address to a list of approved email addresses (_whitelist_). That solution would work in the short term. However, this is a reactive response rather than a proactive. Spam creators would catch on to this early and would use a different set of keywords, being careful not to use any words from the spam list. This would mean that the list of spam phrases will need to be manually updated whenever a new spam email enters the email space. This process becomes even more complex when you factor in what happens when a user receives an email from a known contact whose email account has been compromised (or \"hacked\"). Also, it can prove to be impractical to use the email service if the user doesn't whitelist every known sender.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be contrasted with the machine learning approach. Whenever an email comes in, the user has the ability to manually flag the email as spam. The machine learning algorithm, or _learner_, will then gather information about the spam email such as the the subject line, time stamp, sender's email address, and location of server to name a few examples. The _learner_ then begins to recognize patterns in spam. The benefit of this approach means all the users of the email service can both _train_ the learner to recognize spam and benefit from the intelligent spam filtering. If the learner noticed emails being sent from outside of the country during non-business hours tends to be spam, the learner can automatically make the decision to mark the email as spam. This system is effective, but not without its flaws. You may have experienced this when an email sent from a trusted source was marked as spam. While the learner is noticing the trend for spam emails, it can also learn to recognize \"ham\" emails (good emails) by noting the same information about the email (i.e. timestamp, etc.). Over time, the learner can build an intuition of what makes up both a ham and spam email. Once given enough data, learners can flag a spam email, even if it's the first of its kind. This is where machine learning shines: pattern recognition and predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is powerful, and there are multiple ways to go about solving a problem. Does one give the learner all the information all at once or in batches? Should the learner be given examples of labeled ham and spam or be left to discover on its own? These different approaches are important enough to be discussed below and contrasted with the counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "When training a learner with data (e.g. ham and spam examples), the data can either come with labels denoting what the data is (e.g. \"ham\"). When data has labeled data, this is referred to as _supervised learning_. This will allow the learner to predict which label a new email should be _classified_ to. Supervised learning is often done through regression and modeling by splitting a known data set in half.  The first half of the dataset is used to find a regression model and thus train the computer, and then the second half, which the computer has never seen before, can be predicted through machine learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, data without labels is referred to as _unsupervised learning_. Since you have not split the data into a training and a learning data set, the computer doesn't have anything to go on and so has to discover the pattern for itself.  Typically, unsupervised learning programs cluster the data together based on likeness of certain values. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The Alpha Go artificial intelligence was developed to play the game Go. Go is a strategic board game even more complex than chess in which you must surround and capture your opponents' pieces. \n",
    "\n",
    "![The board game Go. White and black pieces are on the board.](Media/learning1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "It was originally thought that the current state of technology wasn't yet capable of artificial intelligence to win matches against human players at the game of Go. However, in October 2015, the artificial intelligence was capable of beating a human player at the game. This achievement is amazing because brute-forcing each possible move of Go is not computationally feasible. Alpha Go was capable of learning from multiple Go games and playing against itself using *reinforcement learning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learner is referred to as an _agent_ in the context of reinforcement learning. The agent observes the environment, performs an action, and is either rewarded or punished depending on the outcome of the choice. The agent will then learn what happened and either perform or avoid the action. This approach is then repeated by taking more actions and learning from them. This is more complex compared to the other systems but provides a great gain in output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch and Online Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine learning algorithm can either be trained on the fly or once and then submitted for use. _Batch learning_ is a system that can learn incrementally using all of the data available. It is important to gather all available data since the batch learning process will need to be stopped and retrained in order to learn new information. This is often called _offline learning_. While the process of training the algorithm can be time consuming, it can fortunately be automated. This is contrasted with _online learning_, which is a system capable of learning incrementally in real time. While this style of incremental learning is possible to update very quickly, the training process is usually never done on a live system such as Google Search. Instead, the system is pulled offline, quickly retrained to extend the algorithms knowledge base and then redeployed to the live environment. The term _online learning_ can be confusing when it's contrasted with offline, so it's safe to think of this system simply as *incrementally learning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance-based and Model-based Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning systems can generalize based on instances or models. Spam emails can be flagged and the learner can spot patterns in emails to flag future spam email never before seen. The learner can generalize patterns via _instance-based_ learning or _model-based_ learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Instance-based_ learning is the human equivalent of learning by heart. This is effective for known data, such as the spam email, but it suffers when predicting new spam email with new terminology. Fortunately, measuring the similarity between two emails allows the learner to determine whether or not an email is spam provided some threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Model-based_ learning takes a set of examples and builds a model that represents the data. Predictions can be made using the model as the source of knowledge. Suppose you wish to test the hypothesis that higher rated movies make more money. Being an aspiring data scientist, you collect the top 20 movies, create a table, and plot the rating versus gross income on a graph.\n",

Statistics tend to be a little bit more about the \"how\" and \"why.\" They'll give you a little more information about what's going on, so you can explore and understand your data better, and make changes to best practices based upon it. Neither is a better approach - they are just very different.  To get an even better feel for how to utilize all the tools in your arsenal, check out this **[Woz U Blog entitled \"Stats Trained? Re-Orient Yourself Towards Machine Learning and Data Science](https://woz-u.com/stats-trained-re-orient-yourself-towards-machine-learning-and-data-science/)**\n",

    "Now that you understand the basics of machine learning and all the different types, you will learn how to complete supervised machine learning in Python, using linear regression as the supervised machine learning base. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will need to import some packages.  You will need ```pandas``` for loading in data, ```numpy``` for square-rooting your model estimates, ```sklearn``` for the bulk of the linear regression and modeling work, and ```matplotlib``` to graph the model's residuals to get a visual representation of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "With the above data, your goal is to accurately predict housing prices.  This variable is conveniently labeled ```Y house price of unit area``` for you. You will use X variables numbered 2-6 to determine housing prices. When completed, if desired, you should be able to take completely new data, maybe from a new geographic location, and predict housing prices there.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you need to do to kick off machine learning is to create your x and y variables as their own arrays. You cannot feed in the entire dataframe all at once, so you will need to subset your data. The ```x``` data will consist of X2-X6.  You are going to skip X1 since it is a date, and dates can sometimes be tricky to format correctly for machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = realestate[['X2 house age', 'X3 distance to the nearest MRT station', 'X4 number of convenience stores', 'X5 latitude', 'X6 longitude']]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The y data will consist of the target variable, or what you are trying to predict.  In this case, that is housing price: \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Train Test Split\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key things that separates machine learning from statistics is that machine learning utilizes the concept of \"train test split.\" In statistics, you typically run your analysis on all the data you have available.  In machine learning, you split your data in half, and reserve the first chunk for training the model, and the second half for testing the model. How big should a \"chunk\" be? Typically you want more data to be used for training than for testing. 80/20, 70/30, and 60/40 splits are all acceptable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will utilize the ```train_test_split()``` function from ```sklearn``` to split your data.  You will end up with four data sets at the end: \n",
    "\n",
    "* x_train\n",
    "* x_test\n",
    "* y_train\n",
    "* y_test\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be one training dataset and one testing dataset each for x and y.\n",
    "\n",
    "As arguments into the ```train_test_split()``` function, you will place your ```x``` and ```y``` data, and specify how much of your data you want to test with the argument ```test_size=```. In this case, the value of ```test_size=``` is .4, because you are going to use a 60/40 train/test split. This means that you are reserving 40% of your data for testing, and training with the remaining 60%. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x,y, test_size = .4, random_state=101)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will note that another argument is included: ```random_state=101```. This argument is not required when you are doing machine learning on your own, but by everyone using the same number (101), this means that your randomly generated 60% training data will be the same as what is seen in the lesson.  So, including the ```random_state=``` argument into the function makes it a bit easier to follow along, because you will get the same results as what is presented here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed that line, if you want to see the shape of the data you'll be using for your machine learning algorithm, you can then print it out: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(x_train.shape, y_train.shape)\n",
    "print(x_test.shape, y_test.shape)\n",

    "(166, 5) (166,)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is showing that in the ```x_train``` dataset, there are 248 rows and 5 columns, and in the ```x_test``` dataset, there are 166 rows and 5 columns.  So you can see how the training and testing data is broken up.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Create the Linear Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will run the linear regression model on your training data.  You could call this linear model anything you’d like, but below you’ll see it has been named ```lm```.  You will then fit this model to the training data using the ```.fit()``` function, specifying the x and y training sets.  \n",

    "# Challenges in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of the machine learning algorithm, or the _learner_, is dependent on the quality and quantity of data. Additionally, the algorithm itself needs to be well designed and be capable of adapting to new information. Two problems plague data scientists in the world of machine learning: \"bad\" data and \"bad\" algorithms. In this lesson, students will learn the challenges confronting machine learning and the solutions to overcome those challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, you performed your first supervised machine learning task.  Now, you will learn how to cross validate the algorithm to ensure it truly is the best fit.  \n",

    "## \"Bad\" Data\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problems concerned with \"bad data\" is when there is an _insufficient amount_ of data to make accurate decisions. Researchers at Microsoft investigated how algorithms can be used to solve the shortage of data and **[published a paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/acl2001.pdf)** in 2001. In the paper, they compared the performance of different machine learning algorithms. Their conclusion? The algorithms performed almost identically on complex tasks once given enough data. The authors of this research study summarized the findings as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> _\"These results suggest that we may want to reconsider the trade-off between spending time and money on algorithm development versus spending it on corpus development.\"_ Michele Banko and Eric Brill (Microsoft Researchers)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the multiple learning algorithms were converging to the same accuracy, the researchers were lead to believe that acquiring more data is more economical (time and money) than attempting to perfect an algorithm. In short, the learner can only be as smart as it knows how to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also makes sense intuitively. The more data there is to model, the less susceptible the model is to noise (i.e. outliers). A learner is capable of predicting unseen events based off of previously seen data by generalizing. However, the data that is used to train the model must be _representative_ of the data that will be seen during real world use cases. Not only does the data need to be representative of the real world, it must also be _quality_ data. This means the data needs to be free of errors, outliers, and noise. If the data contains these outliers, then _data cleaning_ needs to happen before the model can be properly trained.\n",

    "### Overfitting and Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "One trap learners can fall into is _overfitting_ data. Overfitting is when the model performs well (nearly perfect) on the training data but fails at generalizing to new data. It presumes that the training data includes every known case, and as such will force-fit the data. This ties into the problem where there is an insufficient amount of data to create a model accurate enough to generalize unseen cases: the model will overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, _underfitting_ occurs when the model is too simple (e.g. linear) when the structure of the data is more complex. For instance, using a linear model to project what time of day is best to sell stocks in the stock market is very likely to be too simple a model. This can be remedied by using a more complex model, such as a polynomial model, which can account for more variables and attempt to fit more complex data structure. As a rule of thumb, the more features there are about a model, the \"smarter\" the learner can be when predicting events. However, there can be a time when there are features present that are irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Irrelevant Features\n",
    "\n",
    "_Irrelevant features_, as the name implies, are features not necessary to have in order to make an educated prediction. The process of _feature engineering_ focuses on choosing which features are relevant and which are not. Feature engineering involves two processes: _feature selection_ and *feature extraction*. _Feature selection_ is when the most useful features about a dataset are used for training the model. _Feature extraction_ is when features are combined to produce new ones in a process known as *dimensionality reduction.* \n",

    "Train-test-split is a good first step, but what happens if, for whatever reason, the split ends up not being random?  It’s important to perform additional cross-validation steps to ensure that bias hasn’t been introduced to your model through the split method.  \n",

This method is computationally quite expensive (takes a long time to process), so it should really only be used for smaller datasets.  Therefore, this method is only mentioned  here, and you won't practice it.\n",

So if one is good, isn’t more better?  You can create as many iterations of training as you like, with the number of iterations indicated as *k*.  You will use all iterations but one to train the data, and leave the last for testing the final model.  You thus can feel incredibly confident (and thus convey that confidence to supervisors and customers) that the data and model is as accurate as it can possibly be.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a visual of the k-folds cross validation method, using four iterations.  You can see that iterations 1-3 each have a different testing set, and uses the rest of the data for training.  When you arrive at the fourth iteration, you then use all the data available.\n",
