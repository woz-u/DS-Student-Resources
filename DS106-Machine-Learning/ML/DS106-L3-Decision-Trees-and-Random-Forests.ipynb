    "\n",
    "*Decision trees* are effectively flow charts.  Start with a question, and based on the answer to that question, ask another question until you reach a terminal answer.  Each question you ask is considered a *Node* or a point of divergence and an *Edge* is the path from one Node to another.  The first Node, or the place you start, is called the *Root Node*.  Finally, the possible outcomes on the far end are the *Leaves*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below you have a very simple decision tree, for discerning shapes.  It is called a decision tree because it is very similar to a tree in that it \"branches off.\"  Think about a tree, and turn it on it's head, and you would have the general shape of your decision tree. \n",

    "![Three horizontal lines. From top to bottom, the lines are labeled root node, node, and leaves. An upside tree is placed on the lines on the left. Above the root node line is a single point with two lines extending downward from it. The line on the left is labeled triangle. The line on the right is labeled square. In the node section, there are two points, each of which connects to the lines descending from the root node section. The point on the left has two lines descending from it, one line labeled straight and the other labeled rotated. The point on the right has two lines descending from it, one line labeled straight and one line labeled rotated.

    "## What is a Random Forest? \n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree by itself may not be horribly accurate, because of variance in a dataset, which brings you to the next concept: *Random Forests*. Random Forests are a collection of decision trees where the Nodes, or classification points/questions, are randomized.  For every Node, the program considers *M* number of variables and choose one of them.  By convention, M is usually the square root of *P*, which is the total number of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you're wondering how Random Forest fits into the context of machine learning for data scientists. Well, it's a supervised technique, used to predict the target variable or classification simply by learning decision rules from the data.  \n",

    "## Why use Random Forests over other Methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree regressor is a more powerful model compared to the linear regression seen in this course. The power of decision trees lies within its ability to identify nonlinear relationships within the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other tree methods can introduce multicollinearity, meaning that it makes the trees too highly correlated.  If you average things that are already a lot alike, you are not reducing variability and instead are introducing bias.  But random forests randomizes everything equally and can thus reduce bias and prevent your tree outcomes from overlapping excessively. Random forests are also an awesome choice because there are no assumptions to test for, you don't need to scale any variables, and the model itself doesn't need a lot of playing around to get a good fit right off the bat.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weaknesses of Decision Trees and Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are not without their downsides. While decision trees are great for complex datasets, they overfit the data and as a result do not generalize well. This would make it extremely difficult to model and predict spam emails from entering the inbox. Additionally, decision trees can become unstable in a noisy environment. At each decision layer the noisy data can alter the shape of the tree and path decisions in it.\n",

    "Random forests also have a catch - they can get very complex very fast! When you starting adding in all the variability in predictor variables, category levels, number of decision trees, and any model tuning you might want to do, you can end up requiring a lot of processing! Remember combinations/permutations from probability? Well things can get huge quickly, and that will increase your needs for processing power and time. \n",

If they are not satisfied with the accuracy, then they try to adjust their dataset or work with other tests.  Besides being an invaluable tool, which many jobs require, it is something fun to tell your friends, “I have walked the Random Forest and mastered its wiles!” \n",

    "When you have more than one x variable in a machine learning model, how do you know which one of them is important? Are they all equally important? Do some help predict y more than others? If you were doing regression, you could find out by looking at the individual *p* values related to the variable, or you could do a stepwise regression of some sort to tease out how much each matters. But these options don't exist for machine learning. However, something called *feature importance* does.\n",

    "## Feature Importance in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a pretty quick and easy line of code to get feature importance! They are outputs of your model, and so you just need to call them in a format that is useful. You'll create a new variable called `feature_importances` that is formatted as a pandas series, using the function `pd.Series()`. Then, you can call `forest.feature_importances_`, which by default is created when you run `forest`. Lastly, for readability, you can index it with the argument `index=` and put in `x.columns` so that the name of the column names in your dataset show on the left.\n",

The `sort_values()` function will sort them. The `inplace=True` argument, like always, makes this change permanent, and `ascending=False` means that this goes from largest to smallest, which is exactly what you'd like to see! Then all you need to do is print it out and do a little happy dance. \n",
