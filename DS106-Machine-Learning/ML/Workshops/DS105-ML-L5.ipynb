    "A `corpus` can be defined as a collection of text documents. It can be thought as just a bunch of text files in a directory, often alongside many other directories of text files. How it is done ? NLTK already defines a list of data paths or directories in nltk. Examples of `corpus` is the Project Gutenberg EBooks, Google Books Ngrams, and arXiv Bulk Data Access. There are many text corpora from newswire. Examples are 20 Newsgroups and Reuters-21578. For informal genre, we can include web data and emails.\n",

    "`Stop words` are a set of commonly used words in a language. Examples of stop words in English are `“a”`, `“the”`, `“is”`, `“are”` and `etc`. `Stop words` are commonly used in Text Mining and `Natural Language Processing (NLP)` to eliminate words that are so commonly used that they carry very little useful information.\n",
