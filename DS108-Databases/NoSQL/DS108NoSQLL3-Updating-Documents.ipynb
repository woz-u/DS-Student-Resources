    "## Update a Single Document\n",
    "\n",
    "The `updateOne()` method is the simplest of the update methods. Below is the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "db.[collection].updateOne({filter}, {update}, {options})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above query will find the first document that matches the filter. It will then update the data to whatever has been set in the query. This will be using the `$set` keyword. Lastly, there are particular options that you can use at the end of your query. Below is an example of an `updateOne()` method using your `appusers` database:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "db.appusers.updateOne({\"_id\" : 1}, { $set : { \"middleName\" : \"Gertrude\"}}, { upsert : true})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, you are using the `updateOne` command to change the middle name of your user with an `\\_id` value of 1 to `Gertrude`. In this case, your filter criterion is that the `\\_id` is equal to one, and then you want to set the `middleName` value to `Gertrude`. So, you have your _Filter_, you have your _Update_, and you are using the _Option_ `upsert`, which means \"if found then update, otherwise insert.\"  You will learn more about `upsert` within this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should get a result from MongoDB that gives you the normal ‘acknowledged’ message of true, followed by a ‘matchedCount’ of 1 and a modifiedCount of 1 as well. It told you that it did find and modify exactly one row, changing the middle name to `Gertrude`. That was expected, as your filter condition was on the `\\_id`, and you know that value to be unique in your collection. Take a moment now to execute a `find()` command and examine the document to verify that it did make the change you requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Update Many Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "The `updateMany()` method is very similar to `updateOne()`. The difference is that instead of finding the first document that matches the filter in the query, it will find and update all documents that match the filter. See below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "db.appusers.updateMany({\"firstName\" : \"Tommy\"}, { $set : { \"middleName\" : \"Henry\"}}, { upsert : true})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above query will set all documents with a `first name of \"Tommy\" to have a `middle name of \"Henry\". If you noticed, there is something that says `upsert : true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using update()\n",
    "\n",
    "The `update()` command has all of the functionality available to it that both the `updateOne()` and `updateMany()` methods have when combined. In the last `{}` block in the statement, you previously include `upsert : true`, which is available to all three of the `update()` variations (updateOne, updateMany, update). Unique to the generic `update()` command is another option called `multi`, a boolean value. Setting this to true makes your `update()` command function as an `updateMany()`, while setting it to false makes the `update()` act as if it was an `updateOne` command. So it can do both, but you need to specify which you are intending. An example of the syntax is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "db.[collection].update( {filter}, {update}, {upsert : true/false, multi: true/false})\n",
    "```\n",

    "    </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you know how to query a basic update method, it's now time to explore the query's parameters more in-depth. You have learned how to filter in previous lessons, and those query selectors are all applicable here. Now you'll look at the _Options_ available to you for the update methods.\n"

    "\n",
    "Now take a look at an example. Consider the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "db.appusers.updateOne({\"firstName\" : \"Tommy\"}, { $set : { \"middleName\" : \"Henry\"}}, { upsert : true})\n",

    "\n",
    "But what if the value does not exist? That’s where the `upsert` option comes into play. If a `middleName` does not exist, it will change the `update` into an `insert`, and add a `middleName` field for that document. Now, take a look at your user \"Coderboy\". Time to find \"Coderboy\" by his first name and add a middle name, \"Cole\". The syntax for this upsert becomes:\n",

This method will replace the entire contents of your document with a new document that you will specify in a command.
