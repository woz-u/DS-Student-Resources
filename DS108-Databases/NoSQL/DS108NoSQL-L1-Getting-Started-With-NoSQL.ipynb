    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the world of Database Solutions outside of the scope of the traditional relational database model, known collectively as `NoSQL`. During this course, you will learn the basics of a particular kind of NoSQL solution known as MongoDB, which has been labeled as \"web-scale\" in some circles. Databases have always served as a core component of software development. Understanding how to store and retrieve data is essential to any non-trivial application. Throughout this course, you will learn more about the history of databases, the different types of databases, and more. Understanding document databases and NoSQL solutions provide a valuable skill that will be useful in nearly any development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this course, you will be able to design, implement and modify basic databases, as well as interact to retrieve, store, and modify meaningful data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases are a complex topic with a lot of history, but this foundational course will prepare you with a basic working knowledge of these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different Types of NoSQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, you will be using the most common form of NoSQL database, a document store database. However, there are other forms of NoSQL databases. There are Key-Value databases, Graph-based databases, Wide-Column stores, and the Document store you'll be using here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document Stores\n",
    "\n",
    "Document store databases are likely the most common NoSQL databases you will encounter. They contain documents usually in a JSON format but include a unique key maintained by the data store to identify each document. Using the unique key, one document can reference another document similar to a foreign key in a SQL table. Since there is no static structure of the JSON documents, the data store can remain very flexible. The most common Document Store databases are MongoDB and Couchbase. MongoDB is the database you will be using in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key-Value Stores\n",
    "\n",
    "A Key-Value store is the simplest and fastest NoSQL database since it only contains an identifier and value for each record, which is similar to the use of variables in programming languages. An identifier is used to determine where a piece of information can be located within the database. This is the key. To return the value, simply use the key which represents the storage of that value. Some of the more common Key-Value store databases are Redis, Riak, and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases are very similar to document stores with an additional layer of relationship binding between the documents. Instead, these documents are called `Verticies`, `Nodes` or `Points` while the relationships between these vertices are called `Edges`. Graph databases are designed so that vertices are based around nouns such as persons, places, and objects. Using edges to declare the relationships between vertices rather than a key/foreign-key relationship separates the connections from the data itself. This allows for a change of relationships or data to not affect each other. Some of the more popular Graph Databases are Neo4J.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wide Column Stores\n",
    "\n",
    "Wide column stores are perhaps the hardest to understand. The simplest way to think of them is like a SQL database table, but each record has its own column name and, the key is required. Another way of imagining it is like a Document store where a predefined key is associated with the document, and the document cannot have any sub-documents. The complexity of Wide Column stores tends to shy people away from using them, but large amounts of data can be stored this way conveniently without the need for a specific structured table like a SQL database has. They also tend to be incredibly fast because of the one-for-one relationship between the key and the data. The most popular Wide Column store database is Cassandra."

    "# What is NoSQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **NoSQL** refers to a data storage system that does not have the relational constraints and model that a traditional SQL RDBMS (relational database management system) has. NoSQL stands for \"Not SQL,\" \"Non-SQL,\" or more recently, \"Not Only SQL.\" It is a category of storage solutions, of which there are various types. The last term, \"Not Only SQL,\" actually refers to a storage system that is not SQL, but it is similar to SQL when interacting with your data. The main difference between SQL and NoSQL is the presence of a predefined schema. With a SQL database, you create tables that contain only certain information and act as a blueprint for organizing your data. With NoSQL, the NoSQL databases are built to allow data insertion without a predefined schema or blueprint in SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are _four_ categories of storage solutions for most of the systems that qualify as NoSQL. As new ones are continually coming into existence, there is some cross-pollination of ideas and functionality, so these categories are by no means absolute. However, at this time, most of the solutions can fit into these four types: **Document Database**, **Key-Value Database**, **Graph Database**, and **Object Database**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Document Database**: This is the primary version of NoSQL that you will be interested in, as MongoDB is a document-oriented database. The key concept for a document database is that data for a particular purpose or entity are grouped as a single document and stored as such. Each document in your database will have a unique identifier, which you will use to complete your CRUD operations. The most popular type of structures for documents in these databases are BSON, XML, or JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Key-Value Database**: Probably the most aptly named version of a NoSQL solution, a Key-Value database is simply that - a single, unique key for every set of data that you store in the database. It is sometimes referred to as a dictionary - as it works in the same fashion. In a dictionary, the word itself that you look up would be the _key_, and the _value_ associated with that key would be the word's definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Graph Database**: This is a term you should be familiar with, as with the explosion of social networking, they have gained popularity quite a bit. Under the hood of a Graph Database, you will usually find the storage to be a Key-Value or Document Database. Still, they are structured with nodes and edges properties to represent relationships instead of containing the relationships in the data like an RDBMS does.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Object Database**: An Object-Oriented database, sometimes abbreviated OODBMS, is a database where the data itself is stored in the form of objects. An object will contain all information about a specific record in the database. Think of it like a car - it has weight, color, wheels, windows, and it stops and starts. All of this information is contained in one place: an object. An object also allows for different types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have an idea of what NoSQL is, it is time to dive into creating a database.\n"

In order for this function to work, it needs to know the name of the collection to create.

    "# Inserting Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier in this lesson, you learned what documents look like within a MongoDB collection. Each document has a field and a value. That value can then be an embedded document if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insert a Single Document\n",
    "\n",
    "Before inserting documents, make sure you have a playground up, running, and connected to your database.\n",
    "\n",
    "To insert a single document into a collection, you would use `insertOne()`. The generic syntax for inserting is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "db.collectionName.insertOne([document_schema])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `[document_schema]` is the document itself and includes the fields and values separated by commas (`,`) within curly braces (`{}`). When inserting documents, you must make sure that each document has a unique identifier, usually an `_id`. MongoDB will automatically create one for you if you insert a document without an `_id` field. If you would not like to do that, you can identify the document ID yourself. You **MUST** make sure that the documentID does not already exist, or you will have an error thrown when you try to run the insert. Since your `appusers` collection is empty, you should add a new user to your collection, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "db.appusers.insertOne({_id:1,lastName:\"Pumpernickel\", firstName:\"Georgina\", middleName:\"Sasquatch\", age:27, gender:\"f\"})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead and run the above query in the playground. Other than the fact that poor Georgina has an unfortunate name, you should have also noticed the addition of the `_id` field, and you’ve assigned it a value of 1. This will succeed, and MongoDB will return an `\"acknowledged\" : true message`, with an `\"insertedId\" : 1` along with it. The critical part here is to make sure that you don’t duplicate when you specify the ID yourself, or your insert will fail. If you want to be sure that your data insert will succeed, you can let MongoDB generate that unique value for you and use the value that it provides in your code moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now add another user, leveraging the flexible schema you learned about earlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "db.appusers.insertOne({_id:2,lastName:\"Wilson\", firstName:\"Coderboy\", age:18, favoriteColor:\"blue\"})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should run this command and get the same acknowledgment message as before, except this time you will see that the `InsertedId` is 2. Notice the differences: Georgina has a middle name and gender specified, while Coderboy does not - yet Coderboy has a favorite color specified. Ideally, you’d have an initial set of fields that you would deem acceptable as entries into your \"persons\" documents, and a subset of those are what you would be populating. This will be important later as you create indexes in your MongoDB database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you want to see all documents within your database, you can run a query to see both of your documents. See below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "db.appusers.find({})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above query will find all documents within the `appusers` collection. You should now see both documents you have inserted and all of the fields included.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inserting Many Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.insertMany()` query is the companion to insertOne, where you can insert several documents into the same collection at once. The syntax is somewhat similar:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "db.collectionName.insertMany( [ {document1}, {document2}, … {documentN}])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n",
    "        <p>When inserting many documents, all documents must be within square brackets <code>[]</code> for the insert query to run correctly.</p>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The specification of having an `_id` field or not will work exactly the same as the insertOne command. You can specify one if you want, but make sure that it’s not already in use. Now add a few more rows to your original `appusers` collection, and see how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "db.appusers.insertMany([{lastName: \"Anstruther\", firstName: \"Jimmy\", age: 21}, {lastName: \"Stevens\", firstName: \"Amelia\", age: 28},{lastName: \"Hopkins\", firstName: \"Fred\", age: 35, favoriteColor: \"Green\"}])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the last document has an extra field \"favoriteColor\" that the first two documents in the query do not have. Also, you did not include id's for the three new users like you did with the first two users added. Because of the flexible schema, you can do this. Go ahead and run the above query. You should get the following message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"acknowledged\": true,\n",
    "  \"insertedIds\": {\n",
    "    \"0\": {\n",

    "```js\n",

    "Now that you have gone through plenty of inserting, return to your `Collections` tab in Atlas. Refresh the page, and you should see that your `appusers` collection now has five documents. You can click on the collection and see each document and the fields and values included.\n",

    "## Create Collection When Inserting\n",
    "\n",

    "This Hands-On is structured into _two_ parts, and each part may ask you to run multiple queries. After each query, please take a screenshot and add it to a text document (or an equivalent) and name this file `NoSQL-HandsOn1`. This way, you will be able to submit your answers to each part all at once. You will continue working with the `appusers` collection in Atlas that you created during the lesson. Good luck! \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Create three more users of your choosing, using the `insertOne()` query, and add them to the `appusers` collection.\n",
    "    - Include at least the `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age` fields. Feel free to also include any other fields you think would be useful data for an app user.\n",

    "1. Create a new collection within your database through Atlas. \n",
    "    - This new collection should be named `cars`. \n",
    "2. Insert five cars into this collection using the `insertMany()` query. \n",
    "    - Include the following fields: `make`, `model`, `color`, `year`, `fourDoor`, and `fourWheelDrive`. \n",
    "        - The last two fields, `fourDoor` and `fourWheelDrive`, should be of type Boolean (i.e. true or false). \n",
    "3. Once that is done, run a `find()` query to see your newly created documents. \n",
    "4. Lastly, return to Atlas and view your collection and documents there.\n",
