    "When an index is created on a field that has an array as its value, MongoDB creates an index for each element in the array. This is called a **Multikey Index**. These multikey indexes make queries against arrays much more efficient. They can be created over arrays that hold strings or numbers _and_ nested documents. So the array could look like this:\n",
