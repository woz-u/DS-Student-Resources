    "Remember that relational databases use a relational model of data. A relational model organizes data as relations, or sets of tuples. For example, imagine a customer relation, where each tuple represents a customer. Each tuple would have attributes describing each individual customer, with information like first name, last name, customer number. One or more of those attributes will be used as a key to uniquely identify each customer tuple. The relational model allows logical operations to be performed between tables, or relations. "
