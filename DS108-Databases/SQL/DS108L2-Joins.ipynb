The difference between an inner an outer join has to do with when a row is selected to be included. Say there was a row in `albums` that was not linked to any rows in `tracks`. An inner join only includes the specified columns from a row if it can be paired up with a row in the joined table. So a row in albums that doesn't match any row in tracks would not show up at all in the results. Outer joins change this. An outer join takes every row from either the left or right (hence the `LEFT OUTER JOIN` or `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`) and _if a matching row exists in the other table_, then those columns are included as well.\n",
