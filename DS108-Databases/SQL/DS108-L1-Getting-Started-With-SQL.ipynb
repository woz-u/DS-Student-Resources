    "# What's in a database\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, while a database is a collection of data that is organized for quick search and retrieval, a __Database Management System__ (DBMS) is software that _manages_ databases. A __Relational DBMS__ (RDBMS) is a type of DBMS that stores data in tabular form with relationships between the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical implementation of a database management system is typically architected before the RDBMS is even installed. While installations of an Enterprise-Level DBMS can be quite extensive and complicated, a DBMS can run with as little as two parts: the program, or database 'engine', and a storage medium of some type. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Database Servers\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common kind of database. It consists of the following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A standalone process responsible for managing interactions with the database**\n",
    "* **A reserved space on your hard drive where it will store data**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've ever visited a WordPress site and wondered how the web page got the data it's displaying, it came by asking (usually called querying) a database service. This service might be on the same computer, it might be on a different computer, and it might be multiple individual computers all coordinating to appear as one logical database system. This system is responsible for managing all the requests to access and modify the data from potentially many simultaneous consumers in a way that guarantees data will not be lost or corrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Embedded Database\n",
    "\n",
    "In situations where running a dedicated service is unnecessary or impractical such as for use by a single app on a mobile device, there are embedded databases. These systems move the database service from being a standalone process to being part of the application itself. To be easy to work with, these systems also generally store all data in a single file. When you downloaded the Sakila database, you were getting one of these self-contained databases. The `MySQL Workbench` application contains the database system needed to know how to read and write to this file. If you had two copies of MySQL Workbench running at the same time and both opened the same database, it would be possible to corrupt the data inside, since there would be no single process to mediate conflicting operations on the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relational Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this module, you will be exploring and learning about a SQL database. A SQL database is a relational database which means the database organizes the data into one or more tables of columns and rows. Typically, the table will represent one \"entity type\". For example, we would not have customer information and product information located in the same table; they would be in two different tables. The rows in the table will represent one record of the table. For example, if the table holds all customer information, one row would include all info on one customer (i.e., Name, Address, Phone Number, etc.). The columns represent the values in each record. One column could be the Name or Address for all customers.\n"

To create a row in the database, you will need to insert the data associated with each column. When doing this, you need to insert all of the data or none of it; you cannot insert only some of the row. However, you may encounter a situation where you don't have all the information for each column. In that case, the data missing for each column can be set as NULL. NULL is used to specify that the data doesn't exist, but will prevent the column from being empty. You **cannot** have empty data within a row.\n",
