    "# Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes deal with the ordering of your data and have a significant impact on the performance of your database. They are used to retrieve the data from the database very quickly and improves the read time of the data. On the other hand, it lengthens the write-time when creating a new record. Let's explore why.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two particular types of indexes in SQL server to concern yourself with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clustered Index:** this is the actual, physical order of the data as it is stored on disk. When you have a clustered index, the SQL server stores it by that column. You can only have one of these on a table, and because of this, it is common that the primary key is also the clustered index. There are times you will want this not to be the case, but the vast majority of situations this will be your default. Think of it like a dictionary: the data is ordered in alphabetical order throughout the entire book, and when a new word is added, it is not added at the end, but where it belongs alphabetically.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Non-Clustered Index:** creates an entirely different object within the table. It contains the column or columns selected for indexing and points to the table's rows containing the data. The purpose of an index is to provide a way to expediently get your query results, without having to examine every row in a given table.\n",
    "  The tradeoff of indexes is that when you create one, you copy all of the data you are indexing into a new structure with the order you have specified. Because of this, if there are too many indexes on a table, you may very well have far more storage dedicated to indexes than the actual storage of the table itself. It's not uncommon to see a table with many columns and 500mb of storage to have index space usage of over 1GB. Another drawback of too many indexes that is that you may incur performance issues on heavily inserted/updated/deleted tables. That's because every time you do one of these operations – the same operation must be completed on every index to ensure data integrity. So index intelligently, and as infrequently as possible! A Non-Clustered index is like an index at the back of a book: keywords and references are stored there with the page numbers of the material for quick reference. Anytime the book is updated, the index needs to be updated as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create Index\n",
    "\n",
    "The CREATE INDEX statement is used to create indexes in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below query will create an index on a table. In this case, duplicate values are allowed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE INDEX index_name\n",
    "ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name\n",
    "ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, when you run a query on with the same specific columns you defined in the CREATE INDEX, it should pull in that data quicker than just running a query without an index. Make a note that your database isn't extremely large, so you may not see a considerable change in the speed of the data being pulled in. When you start working with a database with millions of rows, that's when indexes are vital and will help speed up the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead and run the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE INDEX filmListing\n",
    "ON sakila.film (film_id)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "Welcome to the Final Project for the SQL course! Great job making it this far! This Final Project will be different from the Hands-On projects you have previously seen in a couple of different ways. For the Final Project, you will be putting together the numerous topics you have learned into one large project. It is designed to mimic real problems which you may face in your career, so it may be a challenge for you and will also take several hours. Take this project step-by-step and be aware that the project description below is written to be a bit less specific than previous Hands-Ons. The Final Project is supposed to challenge you to do some problem solving to figure out how to accomplish a task. You can always review past lessons or use a Google search if needed. Please read through the following setup instructions before you start the project. Good luck!\n",

    "This Final Project is structured into three parts, and each part may ask you to run multiple queries. After each query, please take a screenshot of the MySQL Workbench output and add it to a Word document (or an equivalent) and name this file `SQL-FinalProject`. This way, you will be able to submit your answers to each part all at once.\n",
