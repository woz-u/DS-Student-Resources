    "The biggest issue new students run into is how to adjust their thinking to a style that is necessary for data science. Even as computers become more advanced, they continue to be very good at doing exactly what you tell them to do &mdash; even if it makes no sense at all. This means that you must become very good at saying precisely what you want the computer to do. This seems easy enough at first &ndash; after all, you communicate with other people all the time &ndash; but it is notoriously difficult to get right early on. Other people are capable of understanding your intent, adding context, and asking for clarification when they do not understand. Computers do none of this. At best, computers give an error when they do not understand and at worst they will carry out an instruction that you did not intend. This leads to problems with your program, crashes, or even data loss. The process of learning to think like a programmer is part learning to be very specific and part learning how to deal with seemingly impossibly-large problems. You'll go into both of these throughout this lesson.\n",

    "## How To Eat An Elephant\n",
    "\n",
    "There's an old joke, `\"How do you eat an elephant?\"` which seems absurd at first. Eating an elephant is not something that any human is going to be able to do. The punchline: `one bite at a time` while corny, does have an element of truth to it. Given enough time and small enough bites, you probably _could_ eat an elephant. So it is with large problems, both in programming and elsewhere. Doing a large report, cooking a three course meal for 20 guests, and using machine learning are all impossible to do in one step. They must be broken down into smaller pieces until you are left with a pile of achievable tasks."

    "There is one more type of challenge you will look at in this lesson; deconstructing word problems. This type of problem is the most challenging for many people. Word problems, while potentially intimidating, closely resemble real-world data science programming tasks. It is very unlikely that you will be handed a well-written specification from a client, instead of a verbal or text based communication to express the desired solution. The actual implementation of that solution requires you to pick apart what you have been given, to connect what is being asked for with a set of tools you have at your disposal, and then formulate a plan for solving the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the problem statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "I have a list of scores from a survey sent out to our clients. I want to know how well we did across all the scores as a single number.\n",

    "What data is present in this sentence? What kind of data is it?\n",

    "**After you've come up with an answer, hover your mouse pointer here: A list of scores (numbers)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you know the basic elements that are available, you can determine what to do with them. Should you add all the numbers together? Should you pick the largest or the smallest number?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is asking for a single number that represents the values of all the individual scores. None of the suggestions above would accomplish this.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have several very high numbers and a few low numbers, you would expect the answer to be relatively high. If you had several low numbers and one single high number, you might expect the answer to be higher than your low numbers but well below the single high number.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what kind of operation is being asked for here?\n",

    "After you've come up with an answer, hover your mouse pointer here: The mean (average) of all the scores.\n",

    "What's important here is identifying the question. In this case, it required an understanding of averages and recognizing it as the question. If you did not know what an average was ahead of time, it would be difficult to solve that particular problem.\n",

    "The skills of deconstructing problems and then precisely communicating your instructions will take time to hone. Fortunately, you will have plenty of chances to practice these skills. Try to remember, the process of breaking down the problem and identifying what you want to do next is often the trickiest part. Writing out your list of `what do I have to work with` and `what steps are needed to accomplish my goal` are valuable skills at any level of experience or technical competency. It's no coincidence that whiteboards and sticky notes are widespread in areas where data scientists are working.\n",

    "> _“Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.”_ – Oscar Wilde\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming there is no truer statement.  You cannot get better at programming without making a lot of mistakes along the way.  In fact, a very common truism in programming is: \n",
    "\n",
    ">_\"If something works the first time you run it, be very afraid._”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mistakes come in all types.  Misspell a word here, use the wrong character there, forget a semi-colon or curly brace there, and all of a sudden you’ll see red on your screen. This should not cause fear.  In fact, errors are your friend.  They’re the greatest teacher and best pathway to learning.  In order to understand what you need to do, you often first need to know what _NOT_ to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "See if you can figure out what’s wrong with the following sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "My friend Ron is from The United Kingdom and he loves French cuisine.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you spot the error? Great! There are, in fact, _more than one_ problem with the sentence above. Did you find them, or did you stop once you discovered the first one?\n",
    "\n",
    "A common issue beginning developers have is that once they encounter an error with their code, they tend to stop paying attention to the rest of it.  They can become fixated on the one problem and not realize another problem might also be lurking.  After they fix the first bug, they will see another error message due to the second problem, but believe the error message is still caused by the first error.  It can take days to realize they fixed the original issue all along.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even experienced developers can spend days trying to fix an error in their code.  Since a computer interprets the language literally, you must be perfect in how you articulate the instructions &mdash; you saw this with the peanut butter and jelly sandwich example.  The instructions might be very clear to you as you write them, but when taken literally they don’t make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking back at the sentence about Ron, despite having two errors, were you still able to understand the meaning?  More than likely you were; however, a computer doesn’t think the same as you do.  It takes a very keen eye and intricate understanding of the language to know that the `T` in the word `the`, when used as an adjective before a proper noun, should be lowercase. That’s the first error. The second error is that there should be a comma before the conjunction `and` to separate the two independent clauses. Miss a comma between arguments when coding, and your computer will definitely be unhappy!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logical Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "There is something else interesting about the sentence above: some grammar-correction software may not detect the errors. As far as the grammar-correction software can tell, `The` might be part of the proper noun `The United Kingdom`.  It has no way of knowing your intention is to use `the` as an adjective to `United Kingdom`.  A similar issue is happening with the missing comma.  Without understanding the intent of the sentence the grammar-correction software will not know that it is two conjoined sentences.  It can only interpret the words in their literal form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these errors are what would be called a `logical error` in programming.  The sentence is grammatically correct as far as the grammar-correction software is concerned, but there are logical errors that cannot be determined by the computer since it can only understand the text literally.  The rules of capitalization and punctuation often require an understanding of the intention of the phrase trying to be conveyed, and this is not something a computer can determine easily.  The same is true with programming.  The computer cannot determine the intent of your code, only the syntax you used to write it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you had a keen eye for both problems, consider how often you make grammatical errors in your own writing.  Now imagine that every grammatical error you ever made was taken literally by a computer.  Would the computer comprehend your instructions?  How often would your intention be misinterpreted by the computer? Could your instructions be performed exactly as you wrote them but have unintended results?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will make many mistakes along the way.  Do not fear them, embrace them.  They will help you grow as a programmer.  The more mistakes you make, the faster you will grow.  As you explore R and Python, it is advised that you even take a little time to break your code after a successful attempt, to learn more about what works, what doesn't and why."
