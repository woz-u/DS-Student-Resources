    "## Using Logical Operators with Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use logical operators with vectors as well. For example, using the vector ```heights```, you can find which heights are less than 180 as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "heights < 180\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n",
    "\n",
    "This condition returns a vector whose elements are ```TRUE``` when the corresponding element of ```heights``` is less than 180 and ```FALSE``` when the corresponding element of ```heights``` is greater than or equal to 180. This kind of vector is called a *logical vector*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a logical vector to select elements of ```heights``` that meet a given condition. This is a very powerful capability when doing data analysis, where it can be advantageous to focus on values that meet a given condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, suppose you want to separate ```heights``` into two vectors: one with the heights of the \"tall\" people, and one with the heights of the \"short\" people, with the dividing line between short and tall arbitrarily set at 180. To create a vector short that contains the values of ```heights``` which are less than 180, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "short <- heights[heights < 180]\n",
    "short\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] 171 177 154 176\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement works as follows. From above, you know that the condition ```heights < 180``` creates a logical vector of ```TRUE``` and ```FALSE``` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first element of this vector is ```TRUE```, since the first element of ```heights``` has a value of 171.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the first element of `heights` is in the ```short``` vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second element of the logical vector created by the condition is ```FALSE```, since the second element of ```heights``` is 192.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that ```short``` does not include the second element of ```heights```.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated for every element in ```heights```; only the elements less than 180 are included in ```short```.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a ```tall``` vector as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "tall <- heights[heights >= 180]\n",
    "tall\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] 192 183\n",

    "new.heights\n",
