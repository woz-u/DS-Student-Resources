You can find more information about the ```tidyverse``` **[here](https://www.tidyverse.org/)**.\n",

Even more importantly, ```ggplot2``` allows for better customization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As you go through this lesson and later lessons, you will learn about what ```ggplot2``` is doing and how it works. But expect a fairly steep learning curve; it may take time before you reach the point where you can bend ```ggplot2``` to your will consistently.\n",

    "## Installing ggplot2\n",
    "\n",
    "The first item of business is to install the ```ggplot2``` package. Fortunately, RStudio makes this easy. You must have a connection to the Internet to do this installation, since it involves downloading packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RStdio, click on the ```Packages``` tab. If you have not rearranged your panes in RStudio, it should be a tab in the lower right window. You should get a display that looks something like this:\n",

There is an option to install dependencies if desired. At the bottom of the window are two buttons, install and cancel.](Media/L05-InstallTab1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Type ```ggplot2``` into the \"Packages\" field, then click on the ```Install``` button. Your Console pane will go crazy for a moment as it installs ```ggplot2``` and the different packages needed to support ```ggplot2```. It may take a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to install packages is to use the function ```install.packages()``` and place the name of the package you are trying to install in the parentheses. For instance, to install ```ggplot2``` without the use of the RStudio controls, you would do the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The end result is the same, however, no matter which method you employ.\n",

    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "library(\"ggplot2\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If your Packages tab is still visible, you should be able to find ```ggplot2``` in the list of packages, and the box by it should be checked. (You could have just checked this box rather than typing the library command.)\n",

    "# Histograms\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have learned previously, a histogram provides a visual representation of the distribution of values in a sample. It would be silly to graph each value by itself, so instead it gets broken into bins.  A bin takes the range of data and divides it into equal segments.  Then so many data points fall into each range of numbers, or bins. Typically, the number of values that fall into each bin are counted, and this count is used to create a bar graph in which the height of each bar is proportional to the number of values that fall into that bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to make a histogram of the height data you used previously.  You will first create the vector of heights and assign it to the variable ```height```:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "height <- c(171, 192, 183, 177, 154, 176)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You then create a data frame from ```height```:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "height_df <- data.frame(height)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You create a histogram with these commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "h <- ggplot(height_df, aes(x = height))\n",
    "h + geom_histogram()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```aes()``` function is where you specify your variables.  You want the variable ```height```, from the data frame ```height_df```. These commands create a histogram that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A histogram. The x axis is h and runs from one hundred fifty to one hundred ninety five, in increments of ten. The y axis is count and runs from zero point zero zero to one point zero zero in increments of zero point two five. Five vertical bars are shaded on the histogram.](Media/L05-Histogram01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding in Bins\n",
    "\n",
    "This also creates a warning: \"stat_bin() using bins = 30. Pick better value with binwidth.\" This histogram has a vertical bar for each height value. Visually, this is not very satisfying. You can make a much more informative histogram by setting the width of each bin to be 10. You accomplish this with the ```bindwidth=``` attribute: \n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "h + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "As you can see, the histogram is just a special kind of bar chart. The horizontal variable is the height in centimeters. Each bar in the chart is associated with a lower value and an upper value on the horizontal axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the bar of height three in the middle of the chart has a lower value of 175 and an upper value of 185. The height of each bar is the number of data values that fall between its lower and upper values.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the height data, there are three values that fall between 175 and 185. These lower and upper values define the bin for each bar; the height of the bar represents the number of data values that fall into the bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no bar (or you can think of it as a bar that has zero height) corresponding to the bin for values between 155 and 165; that is because there are no heights that are between 155 and 165.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vertical axis is labeled ```count``` to indicate that the vertical height of the bars is the number of values that fall into the corresponding bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding a Title and Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "You can improve this histogram by giving it a title of \"Histogram of Heights\" and adding a label to the horizontal axis of \"Height (in cm)\". You can do this with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "h + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) +\n",
    "ggtitle(\"Histogram of Heights\") +\n",
    "xlab(\"Height (in cm)\")\n",

    "## Relative Frequencies\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It is reasonably straightforward to create a box plot using ```ggplot2```. In this section, you will use the ```cars``` dataset that is supplied as part of R. It includes speed measurements (in miles per hour) and stopping distance (in feet) for cars measured in the 1920's. The cars dataset is in a data frame format.  If you want to see the first six rows, you can use the ```head()``` function:\n",

    "\n",
    "5 8 16\n",
    "\n",
    "6 9 10\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the following commands to create a box plot that represents the stopping distance.  Box plots will have no ```x=``` except for empty quotes, and you'll put in the variable you're interested in seeing a box plot with under ```y=```. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "d <- ggplot(cars, aes(x = \"\", y = dist))\n",
    "d + geom_boxplot() + xlab(\"\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This produces the following box plot:\n",

    "![A box plot that shows the stopping distance in feet for cars measured in the nineteen twenties. The y axis is distance and runs from zero to one hundred and twenty five in increments of twenty five.](Media/L05-Boxplot01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The box plot is created from the following values:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Minimum: The smallest value in the vector.\n",
    "* 1st Quartile: The value below which one quarter of the values lie.\n",
    "* Median: The middle value in the vector: one-half of the values are larger, and one-half of the values are smaller.\n",
    "* 3rd Quartile: The value below which three quarters of the values lie.\n",
    "* Maximum: The largest value in the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you can use the ```summary()``` function to compute all of these values (plus the mean).  It works on data frames just as well as vectors, but you will need to specify the variable in the data frame you are interested in using the dollar sign ```$``` after the dataset name.  So, ```cars$dist``` specifies that you want a summary of the ```dist``` variable from the ```cars``` dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Visually.  Anything outside the \"whiskers\" of the plot (the lines at the end) are outliers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mathematically.  Anything 1.5 times higher or lower than the value of the interquartile range (IQR) is an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to inspect the plot above for outliers, you would notice that the point labeled \"outlier\" is in fact after the end of the top whisker.  You could also calculate the IQR (3rd Quartile minus 1st Quartile) to come up with an IQR value of 30 for the stopping distance data. Multiply 30 by 1.5: \n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "30 * 1.5 = 45\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then add this value to your third quartile to find upper outliers: \n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "45 + 56 = 101\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And subtract it from the first quartile to find your lower outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "26 - 45 = -19\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So anything below -19 or above 101 would be considered outliers in your data.  On the chart above, you can easily see that the point labeled an outlier is higher than 101. \n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure of using 1.5\\*IQR beyond the \"box\" part of the box plot is pretty standard, but it is not a hard and fast rule. There are statistical software packages out there that will use different criteria to determine whether a point is an outlier or not; but many packages use this rule of thumb.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Importance of Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering why outliers matter.  Well, especially in a small dataset, one or two outliers can really make a difference! Outliers will mess with the mean of a dataset tremendously.  A few high outliers could raise the mean; a few low outliers may bottom it out.  Consider the ```cars``` dataset: with the outlier in, the mean is 42.98.  When the outlier of 120 is removed, the mean drops to 41.41.  Now that's not a whole lot in this case, but add in just one or two more upper outliers and you may find a completely inaccurate mean that's much higher than it should be.  What is meant by inaccurate? Well, those few high points are having undue influence over the data.  They may be Incredibly Unlikely data points, since they aren't even close to the data, or they may be mistakes in data collection or data entry.  Ever accidentally add an extra zero to something?  A 20 pound baby can become 200 pounds in just one typo! Because outlier data is so improbable, it can bias your data. Outliers always need to be noted, but for some analyses, you may also remove them.  You will learn more about the process of automatic outlier detection and removal at a later point, but it's good to be aware of their influence now! \n",

    "Screening and cleaning your data is one of the most important steps a data scientist can take to ensure high quality data.  Histograms, box plots, and normal probability plots are all great visuals to use for your own internal visualization purposes, so you can get a handle on the normality and number of outliers in your data.  Armed with that knowledge, you will be better able to make judgments about which statistics to use and whether the data you have is accurate.  \n",
