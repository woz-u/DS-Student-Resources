    "    - For Mac, press `command` and the space bar at the same time. Type in `terminal` and press `enter`. A separate Terminal window will pop up.\n",
    "2. Now that you are in your Command Prompt/Terminal, run the following command:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd desktop\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Next, move your command prompt/terminal's location to the new `python_course` you just created by running the following:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd python_course\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "4. Create a _new_ directory within the `python_course` directory. This new folder is the project you will be working in for this lesson. Run the following:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    mkdir lesson_three\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5. Open up a new window in VSCode.\n",
    "6. The first thing you should see a Welcome page. You can close this window.\n",
    "7. Now, its time to open the `lesson_three` directory. Click on the \"Explorer\" button on the left-hand side of the VSCode window.\n",
    "8. You will now see a button that says `Open Folder`, as shown below. Click this button.\n",
    "9. A new window will open that will allow you to search for files and folders. Locate the `python_course` folder you just created on your Desktop. Click on that folder and then locate the `lesson_three` folder. Select the `lesson_three` directory and click the `Open` button.\n",
    "10. Create a new file named `main.py` by one of the following three ways:\n",
    "    - To the right of __LESSON_THREE_ in the EXPLORER is a button that looks like a piece of paper with a plus symbol in its top-left corner. If you hover your mouse over this button for a moment, a popup will appear indicating that this button will create a new file.\n",
    "    - Choose `File > New File` from the app's menu.\n",
    "    - Press `Control + N` in Windows or `Command + N` on a Mac (the plus means \"and at the same time\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the `main.py` file is created, you are ready to go! As you work through this lesson, add the code examples into your project so you can see the output yourself. Remember, to see the output within the VSCode terminal, right-click within your file and choose \"Run Python File in Terminal\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of this new project is for you to practice your new skills. It is highly recommended that you add the code from this lesson into your `lesson_three` project as you learn it. As you are going through this lesson and adding code to your project, you may find it helpful to include `comments` with a brief sentence explaining what is going on in the code. That way, you will have an easy reference to the topics explained in this lesson. Happy coding!\n"

This is where the use of the *index*, or position, of an item in a list is important. Python considers the first item in a list to be at position `0` and not position `1` (unlike R). These positions are integers. This is illustrated below:\n",

    "- If you know the index of the item, you use the `del` command.\n",

    "If you know the index, you can remove an item from a list by using the `del` command. The item to be removed follows the command like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# delete item at index 2\n",
    "del numbers[2]\n",
    "print(numbers)\n",

    "del numbers[-1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one deletes the item at index 2, or the third item. As you can see in the comments, this results in the index changing for the last item, namely `4`. Its index goes from 3 to 2.\n",

    "_But what if there are multiple items in the list with the same value_?\n",
    "\n",
    "Good question! When a list contains the same value multiple times, the __first__ item that matches will be removed, while the others will remain.\n",

    "Looping, or iterating, is an important concept to understand. Undoubtedly, you will need to iterate over lists throughout your programming career. So, below you will find another example to help you gain a solid understanding of iteration using a `for` loop.\n",

    "# 2. an empty list that will store even numbers\n",

    "# numbers to the `even_numbers` list\n",

    "    # 4. if the number is even, add to `even_numbers`\n",
    "    if the_number % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        even_numbers.append(the_number)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Ignoring the odd number: \", the_number)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. print out `even_numbers`\n",
    "print(even_numbers)\n",

    "Ignoring the odd number: 5\n",
    "[2, 4]\n",
    "```\n",

    "In the example above, there are numbered comments that will be discussed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The list `all_numbers` is created first, and it contains numbers from 1 through 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An empty list variable named `even_numbers` is created. This list will, eventually, contain the list of even numbers of the `all_numbers` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `for` loop iterates over each number in the `all_numbers` list variable. The variable `the_number` will contain the value of each number of the list as it loops through. __A colon is required at the end of this line!__\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The four lines of code beneath this comment have the same indentation, so they are considered as one block of code that gets executed for each item in the list. First, it tests whether the current number of the list is even (`the_number % 2 == 0`), and if it is, it adds it to the `even_numbers` list. Otherwise, it prints out a message with the odd number.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once the `for` loop has finished iterating over the list of `all_numbers`, the `even_numbers` list should now contain the even numbers, and it is printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both examples above, the `country` and `the_number` variables in the `for` loops are named as desired. They could have been named any way you'd like, but you should name them such that they make sense. Since the variable name for the list is plural (e.g. \"countries\"), the temporary variable that holds the current value while looping should be singular (e.g. \"country\"), since it represents an individual item.\n",

    "That's it! Next, you'll see another way you can iterate over a list.\n",

Remember, the `+=` operator is shorthand &mdash; it could have been written as `a_number = a_number + 1`. Because you can overwrite variables, you will keep changing the value of `a_number` until that value gets to be `5`, at which point the `while` loop will stop because the condition of `a_number` less than 5 has no longer been met.\n",

For this project, you will be creating a new directory, so please follow the below setup instructions. This Hands-On will **not** be graded, but we encourage you to complete it. The best way to become a great programmer is to practice! Once you have submitted your project, you will be able to access the solution on the next page.\n",

    "1. First, open up your command prompt/terminal\n",
    "2. Within your command prompt/terminal, run the following command:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd desktop\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Next, run the following:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd python_course\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "4. Run the following to create a new directory for this project:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    mkdir lesson_three_handson\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5. Open up a new window in VSCode.\n",
    "6. Click on the \"Explorer\" button on the left-hand side of the VSCode window.\n",
    "7. Click the `Open Folder` button.\n",
    "8. Select the `lesson_three_handson` directory within the `python_course` folder on your Desktop. Click the `Open` button.\n",
    "10. Create a new file named `main.py` by one of the following three ways:\n",
    "    - To the right of __LESSON_THREE_HANDSON__ in the EXPLORER is a button that looks like a piece of paper with a plus symbol in its top-left corner. If you hover your mouse over this button for a moment, a popup will appear indicating that this button will create a new file.\n",

    "    - `my_favorite_flowers` should include 4 different flowers\n",

    "2. Loop through the list\n",
    "3. For every number that is divisible by 3 _and_ 5, print `ZipZap`\n",
    "4. For every number that is divisible by 3, print `Zip`\n",
