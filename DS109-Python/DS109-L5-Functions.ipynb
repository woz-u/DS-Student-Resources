    "Looking back at earlier lessons, do you remember operations such as `print()`, `len()`, and `range()`? From time to time, they were referred to as functions, and you were informed that they would be covered later. Well, here you are!\n",
    "\n",
    "The aforementioned operations that you can now, correctly, call _functions_, are three of several built-in functions that are available to you through the Python library. However, you can also create your own functions. In fact, you'll find yourself building functions constantly as a developer.\n",

    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, open up your command prompt (Windows) or your terminal (Mac/Linux)\n",
    "    - For Windows, navigate to your search bar in the bottom left hand corner. Type in `Command Prompt` and it should pop up. Click on `Command Prompt` and a separate window should appear on your screen.\n",
    "    - For Mac, press `command` and the space bar at the same time. Type in `terminal` and press `enter`. A separate Terminal window will pop up.\n",
    "2. Now that you are in your Command Prompt/Terminal, run the following command:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd desktop\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Next, move your command prompt/terminal's location to the new `python_course` you just created by running the following:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd python_course\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "4. Create a _new_ directory within the `python_course` directory. This new folder is the project you will be working in for this lesson. Run the following:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    mkdir lesson_five\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5. Open up a new window in VSCode.\n",
    "6. The first thing you should see a Welcome page. You can close this window.\n",
    "7. Now, its time to open the `lesson_five` directory. Click on the \"Explorer\" button on the left-hand side of the VSCode window.\n",
    "8. You will now see a button that says `Open Folder`, as shown below. Click this button.\n",
    "9. A new window will open that will allow you to search for files and folders. Locate the `python_course` folder you just created on your Desktop. Click on that folder and then locate the `lesson_five` folder. Select the `lesson_five` directory and click the `Open` button.\n",
    "10. Create a new file named `main.py` by one of the following three ways:\n",
    "    - To the right of __LESSON_FIVE__ in the EXPLORER is a button that looks like a piece of paper with a plus symbol in its top-left corner. If you hover your mouse over this button for a moment, a popup will appear indicating that this button will create a new file.\n",
    "    - Choose `File > New File` from the app's menu.\n",
    "    - Press `Control + N` in Windows or `Command + N` on a Mac (the plus means \"and at the same time\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the `main.py` file is created, you are ready to go! As you work through this lesson, add the code examples into your project so you can see the output yourself. Remember, to see the output within the VSCode terminal, right-click within your file and choose \"Run Python File in Terminal\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of this new project is for you to practice your new skills. It is highly recommended that you add the code from this lesson into your `lesson_five` project as you learn it. As you are going through this lesson and adding code to your project, you may find it helpful to include `comments` with a brief sentence explaining what is going on in the code. That way, you will have an easy reference to the topics explained in this lesson. Happy coding!\n"

    "# What Is a Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "A `function` is a re-usable block of code that, when called, performs a series of operations that are related to a specific task. A function is given a name that you use elsewhere when you wish to perform that series of operations. Using functions improves code readability and decreases development time. The use of functions also reduces maintenance efforts, since logic is grouped into functions instead of being littered throughout the application. If you need to make a change, it's much easier to change one location instead of 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the code below which defines a function. Each piece will be discussed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greeting():\n",
    "    \"\"\"This function prints a greeting\"\"\"\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "greeting()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**OUTPUT:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When _defining_ a function, the first thing you need is the appropriate Python keyword: `def`. This keyword tells the Python interpreter that what follows is a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the function follows the `def` keyword. The name can be anything you'd like, but you want to ensure that it makes sense. Above, the function name is `greeting`. Function naming conventions and rules are similar to those for variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greeting\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After the function's name, you'll find parentheses `()`. When you need to provide information for the function, you'll find _parameters_ inside of the parentheses. Parameters will be discussed shortly, but the above function has none, so there's nothing between each parenthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greeting()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Like `for` and `while` loops, as well as `if` and `else`, when defining a function the first line must end with a colon `:`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greeting():\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the Python code that will be executed when the function is used must be indented, as you can see above. This is no different that an `if` block or `for` loop. The indentation is maintained until the end of the function's definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of code of the function is called a `docstring` (documentation string). A _docstring_ is used to specify the purpose of the function. A function's docstring is defined by including a _string literal_ as the first statement in the function's definition. A _string literal_ is text enclosed within triple-quotes, and they can be a single line or multiple lines. Although it is not _required_, all functions _should_ have a docstring.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greeting():\n",
    "    \"\"\"This function prints a greeting\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The final line of code of the `greeting` function is a call to the `print()` function to print out the greeting. Other than the docstring, this represents the _body_ of the function. The body can contain as many operations as necessary, although the function below only has one.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greeting():\n",
    "    \"\"\"This function prints a greeting\"\"\"\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "greeting()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the function definition, you'll find the line of code that _calls_ the function: `greeting()`. When you define a function, like how `greeting` was defined above, the code is not executed unless it is called, or invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "And there you have it! A function!\n",
    "\n",

    "# Local Variables and Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "When declaring variables inside of a function, they are not related to any other variable with the same name that is used outside of that function; this means the variable names are considered _local_ to that function. This is known as the _scope_ of the variable. All variables have the scope of the block that they are declared in, starting from the definition of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about `scope`, all variables in a program may not be accessible in all locations of that program. It all depends on where the variable was declared. The scope of a variable determines where that variable can be accessed. The two basic scopes of variables in Python are `global` and `local`.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that local variables can be accessed **only** inside the function in which they are declared, whereas global variables can be accessed throughout the program by **all** functions. When a function is called, the variables inside that function are brought into scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **TAKE AWAY:** - Variables that are defined inside a function body have a local scope, and those defined outside have a global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a few examples:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# this `user` variable is declared outside of the function\n",

    "Andrew Jones\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `user` variable that was declared outside of the function is printed. Now, if you want to print the `user` variable in the function you would need to invoke the function like so:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "print(my_function('John', 'Smith'))\n",

    "1. Like in the `map()` example, `numbers` is a list of integers. This represents the input collection that will be filtered.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. This is the lambda function that will return `True` if the parameter is even, otherwise `False`. For items to be included in the results of a call to `filter()`, it must return `True`.\n",

    "3. The `filter` function is called. Like the first `map()` example, you can see that it takes two arguments: the lambda function and the collection. The results of the call to `filter` is stored in the variable `filter_results`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The value returned from the call to `filter` is a filter object, which is converted to a list using the `list()` function like you saw above with `map()`. If it were printed to the console, it would look like the following:\n",

    "    ```python\n",
    "    <filter object at 0x1041e3358>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This prints out the `results` variable, which contains the conversion from the `filter` results to a list. As expected, this prints out a list that contains only even numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've now learned some very important and useful features of the Python programming language. You will find functions everywhere, and in time, you'll find how powerful lambdas can be, particularly when used in conjunction with `map()` and `filter()`. There are, of course, many other applications where lambda functions can be used.\n"
