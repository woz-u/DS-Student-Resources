    "# What is Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Programming** is the ability to come up with a solution to a problem and then write that solution down in a way the computer can understand. This is done through a *programming language*, which gives programmers a tool to specify step-by-step instructions on what to do and how to do it. Programming languages empower programmers to speak to the computer using words rather than the 0's and 1's, or binary, that computers understand. The programming language that programmers use is translated into the binary that a computer understands using a program known as a *compiler*. **Compilers** are the bridge between how you solve your problem using a programming language and what the computer accepts as instructions. This module will empower you as a programmer to build applications that solve a variety of problems.\n",

    "> \"_Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms._\" - **[Python Docs](https://www.python.org/doc/)**\n",

    "I bet you didn't know most common websites on the internet are built using Python! As one of the most popular video-sharing websites in existence, YouTube is powered by Python. Python also provides the power behind Google, the most popular search engine in the world!\n",

    "## History\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in 1991! How many of you were alive then? It has changed a lot since then. Lucky for you, you will be using Python 3, the most recent version.  Python 3 was released in 2008, and there have been several smaller updates since then. The final version of Python 2, which was 2.7, came out in mid-2010 and will, most likely, see no major new releases.\n",

    "A good Python program is considered very easy to read thus labeling the program as a simple and minimalistic language. Having a pseudo-code *like* feel to it is one of Python's greatest strengths. This allows the developer to concentrate on providing a solution rather than the complexity of the language. \n",

    "As you follow along in the lessons, you will see that it is fairly easy to get started using Python. Utilizing its straightforward syntax will have you developing your first program in no time.\n",

    "Well, I hope you're excited because it's time for you to jump right in and get started! In the next section, you will be installing and configuring Python 3 as well as Visual Studio Code, which is the tool that you will be using to build Python applications. Welcome to a whole new world!\n"

When you see a keyword word followed by parenthesis, with or without anything in between them, it is generally what is called a _function_. You will learn more about functions in a later lesson. For now, simply recognize that what you enter between the parentheses is what gets printed. Right now, you're simply printing plain text.

    "    - For Mac, press `command` and the space bar at the same time. Type in `terminal` and press `enter`. A separate Terminal window will pop up.\n",
    "2. Now that you are in your Command Prompt/Terminal, type the following and then press enter:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd desktop\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - The `cd` keyword is for changing locations on your desktop within your command prompt/terminal. This command is currently having you change the location to your desktop\n",
    "    > Tip! A lot of times, you will see something like \"Run the following command in your command prompt/terminal\". This means to type the command and then hit the enter key. You are _running_ a command.\n",
    "3. Now your command prompt/terminal's specified location is the desktop. Run the following to create a new, empty folder named `python_course` on your desktop:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    mkdir python_course\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - The `mkdir` keyword stands for `make directory`. A `directory` is essentially a folder on your computer but in programming is referred to as a `directory`.\n",
    "    - This folder, `python_course`, is where all projects for this course will live, including all projects you create within the lessons and the hands-on projects.\n",
    "4. Next, move your command prompt/terminal's location to the new `python_course` you just created by running the following:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd python_course\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5. Create a _new_ directory within the `python_course` directory. This new folder is the project you will be working in for this lesson. Run the following:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    mkdir lesson_one\n",

    "10. A new window will open that will allow you to search for files and folders. Locate the `python_course` folder you just created on your Desktop. Click on that folder and then locate the `lesson_one` folder you created _within_ the `python_course` directory. Select the `lesson_one` directory and click the `Open` button.

    "11. Once the folder has been opened in VS Code, you need to create your first file. This can be done in several ways:\n",
    "    - To the right of __LESSON_ONE__ in the EXPLORER is a button that looks like a piece of paper with a plus symbol in its top-left corner. If you hover your mouse over this button for a moment, a pop-up will appear indicating that this button will create a new file:\n",

    "        _Figure 1-10: VSCode New File Button_\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Choose `File > New File` from the app's menu.\n",
    "    - Press `Control + N` in Windows or `Command + N` on a Mac (the plus means \"and at the same time\").\n",
    "12. After creating a new file from one of the three above options, you will be able to enter a name for the new file. This file should be named `main.py`.\n",
    "    - In the filename, the characters after the period are called the file's _extension_. It specifies what kind of file it is.\n",
    "        - For example, the filename \"abc.txt\" has an extension of type \"txt\", meaning it is a file used for entering simple text. An Excel spreadsheet has an extension of \"xls\". Python source code files, on the other hand, use `py` as the file extension.\n",
    "    - You may need to right click on the new file and choose `Rename` from the pop-up menu to name the file.\n",
    "13. Once you've created the file and it's open in the editor, take a look at the bottom-right of VS Code. You should see the word \"Python\". This means that VS Code recognizes that this file is to be used for Python code, as shown below:\n",

    "1. Within the `main.py` file, create three variables that are set to the following questions:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    What is your name?\n",
    "    How old are you?\n",
    "    How many months is that?\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    > Hint! Make sure to write these as strings.\n",
    "2. Next, create three more variables that are set to the following answers to the above questions:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    My name is \"Billy\".\n",
    "    30\n",
    "    360\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Use the print function to print each of the variables. The output should looks like below:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    What is your name?\n",
    "    My name is \"Billy\".\n",
    "    How old are you?\n",
    "    30\n",
    "    How many months is that?\n",
    "    360\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - Make sure `Billy` is surrounded by quotes in the output\n",
    "4. Next, comment out the appropriate variables and print functions so the output now looks like below:\n",
    "     ```text\n",
    "    What is your name?\n",
    "    My name is \"Billy\".\n",
    "    How old are you?\n",
    "    30\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5. Finally, create three new variables: `my_string`, `my_integer`, and `my_float`. \n",
    "    - Each variable should be set to the appropriate data type based on the name of the variable name. The actual values you use is not important. What is important is that you match up the right type of data with the right variable. \n",
