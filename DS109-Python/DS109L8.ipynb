    "You have previously had a wonderful introduction to object-oriented programming in Python.  It is very important that you gained a good understanding of the basics that are not data science specific for several reasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "* For more complex work in machine learning or big data, you may need the ability to utilize a text editor like Visual Studio Code and the command line.\n",
    "* In data wrangling, you may find yourself using for loops, dictionaries, and other basics.\n",
    "* Hiring managers may not distinguish between the use of Python for software engineering and Python for data science, which means that you may take skills assessments that will depend on your ability to use Python as an object-oriented language in order to land a job.\n",

    "## How is Python Used for Data Science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, using Python for Data Science is very similar to how you use R.  You'll learn the basic packages (think the equivalent of libraries in R) needed to import and manipulate data, perform data wrangling, conduct statistics, perform machine learning, and so much more! Python is nice for data science because it is so very flexible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparing Python to R as a Data Science Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "R was built for statistics and statistics only.  With that in mind, it provides several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The output from R typically provides more information about the analysis you ran and it is easier to get ahold of this output.\n",
    "* You are allowed to have missing data in many R data analyses, as it will use pairwise deletion. This usually gives you greater power and a little more flexibility with your data.\n",
    "* It sometimes requires less code  or fewer steps to run analyses or data visualizations.\n",
    "* R has a wider range of traditional statistical methods and visuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advent of Python for data science really stemmed from the programming world instead of the statistical world, which means that using Python has its own set of advantages! \n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is typically better equipped for machine learning.\n",
    "* Python connects better to big data programs such as Spark and Hadoop.\n",
    "* It is easier to integrate basic programming elements into Python.\n",
    "* There is more documentation for Python and more people are currently using it, which means that it will be easier to get help solving problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because both Python and R have different strengths, you are encouraged to use both and really get familiar with what each program is capable of.  Then, as you become comfortable, you will be able to choose the program that will best suit your data scientist needs of the day.  Some things are just easier in Python, or easier in R.  It would be silly to struggle through something in Python that is easily completed in R, or vice versa. Think of both programs as complementary, rather than redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "After getting through Programming Basics, you may be feeling frustrated.  You may be thinking to yourself that if you wanted to write code and use the command line all day, you would have chosen to be a programmer, not a data scientist.  Luckily, data scientists came up with a solution that makes Python their own - it's called *Anaconda*! \n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is a data science specific version of Python that comes with two *integrated development environments* (IDEs).  An IDE is basically a user-friendly way to use a program; an example is R Studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first IDE Anaconda comes with is Jupyter Notebook; the second is Spyder.  Both use the same code and function relatively similarly, and both provide output without requiring use of the command line. While you are welcome to use Spyder or Visual Studio Code for the remainder of the course, this course will support the use of Jupyter Notebook.  This is because *Jupyter Notebook* is the most widely used IDE for data scientists at this time, and is even being asked for on job descriptions sometimes.\n",
