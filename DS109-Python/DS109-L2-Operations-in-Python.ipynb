    "    - For Mac, press `command` and the space bar at the same time. Type in `terminal` and press `enter`. A separate Terminal window will pop up.\n",
    "2. Now that you are in your Command Prompt/Terminal, run the following command:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd desktop\n",

    "    ```text\n",
    "    mkdir lesson_two\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5. Open up a new window in VSCode.\n",
    "6. The first thing you should see a Welcome page. You can close this window.\n",
    "7. Now, its time to open the `lesson_two` directory. Click on the \"Explorer\" button on the left-hand side of the VSCode window.\n",
    "8. You will now see a button that says `Open Folder`, as shown below. Click this button.\n",
    "9. A new window will open that will allow you to search for files and folders. Locate the `python_course` folder you just created on your Desktop. Click on that folder and then locate the `lesson_two` folder. Select the `lesson_two` directory and click the `Open` button.\n",
    "10. Create a new file named `main.py` by one of the following three ways:\n",
    "    - To the right of __LESSON_TWO__ in the EXPLORER is a button that looks like a piece of paper with a plus symbol in its top-left corner. If you hover your mouse over this button for a moment, a popup will appear indicating that this button will create a new file:\n",

    "----\n",
    "## String Concatenation\n",
    "\n",
    "The word *concatenation* means to combine. When concatenating strings, you use the `+` operator similarly to how you would add two numbers together. The difference, however, is that no arithmetic is performed. Instead, it simply glues the pieces together. Take a look at the example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_message = \"Hello\"\n",
    "my_other_message = \"how are you?\"\n",

    "print(my_final_message)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the above print() statement would be: `\"Hello, how are you?\"` The value of the `my_message` variable is concatenated with `\", \"` and the value of the `my_other_message` variable using the `+` operator. The result of that concatenation is set as the value of the `my_final_message` variable, before it is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "day = \"1\"\n",

    "# Converting Data to Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist, there will be many times when you need to modify the type of variable you have! Below is a great example - what if some of your variables are set to integers, not strings, but you want to concatenate them? Well guess what? You can't! If you run the code below, you will see that you get an error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "day = 1\n",
    "year = 2017\n",
    "month = \"August\"\n",

    "today_is = month + \" \" + day + \", \" + year\n",
    "\n",
    "print(today_is)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is because you cannot concatenate an integer (int) with a string. This is because the program will read the `+` sign as a `plus` sign rather than concatenation (you will be learning more about arithmetic operations with integers later in this lesson). \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the str() Function\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Formatting Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, instead of using `str()` on every piece of your concatenation, you could instead use the function `str.format()`. If you use it at the beginning in place of concatenation, then you can tell Python what to expect regarding the variables and tell it to format each as a string. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "day = 1\n",
    "year = 2017\n",
    "month = \"August\"\n",

    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "The date is August 1, 2017\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Order Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The `str.format` takes in the string and within the string are empty curly braces `{}`. These curly braces are defined _after_ the string. The definitions of the curly braces are in the order you want the variables to be shown. So, in the above example, you want to see the month, day then year. If you change around those variables, the date will change:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "day = 1\n",
    "year = 2017\n",
    "month = \"August\"\n",
    "\n",
    "today_is = str.format(\"The date is {}, {} {} \", year, month, day)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(today_is)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The date is 2017, August 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to print a string using predefined variables, string concatenation and string formatting are both acceptable ways to accomplish this.\n"

    "Earlier, you learned about comparison operators, such as `==,` `!=,` and <code>&lt;=</code>. The result of an operation using a comparison operator is a boolean; it either results in `True` or `False`. So, for instance, `person_age < 10` is an operation using the less than operator, and the result will be true if `person_age` is less than 10, otherwise false. But what happens if you need to test for multiple conditions? Just like multiple event probability, where you can make use of your boolean operators of \"and\", \"or\", and \"not\", you can use them in Python as well.  You'll start by working with `and`. \n",

    "# conditions\n",
    "is_old_enough = person_age >= age_restriction\n",
    "has_enough_money = person_money >= movie_price\n",

    "# Decision-Making\n",
    "\n",
    "As you write programs in Python, you will undoubtedly encounter situations that will require making decisions. Programming often involves checking a certain set of conditions and choosing an action based upon those conditions. This is done in code much like in real life. Consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A person can watch a movie __if__ they have $10\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be translated to Python pretty easily:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person_money = 12\n",
    "\n",
    "if person_money >= 10:\n",
    "  print(\"This person can watch the movie\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the above code will be \"This person can watch the movie.\" Why? Because they have $12, which is more than $10. The text is printed to the console only if the variable `person_money` has a value that is greater than or equal to 10, because you are only going to execute that command **if** the first statement is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you changed the value of `person_money` to 8, as shown below?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person_money = 8\n",
    "\n",
    "if person_money >= 10:\n",
    "  print(\"This person can watch the movie\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, nothing gets printed to the console. But why?\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition test of whether `person_money >= 10` fails, so the line to print is skipped. This is how `if` statements work. The thing only happens when the condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## General `if` syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `if`, the syntax is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if <condition>:\n",
    "  <operations>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is generic code, so it won't run.  But it gives you the general format of how things should be written, and you will fill in the `<>` with your own conditions and operations. You will always start with the keyword `if`, and then follow that with the condition to test.  In the earlier example, the condition that was being tested was whether `person_money` was at least $10 or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the condition, you'll find a colon (`:`). A colon is required after the `if` and condition tests, or it won't run.  Python will be thinking that everything following is conditional, and will never recognize that it needs to stop and do the operation without that colon! You can think of the colon like a stopsign.  Without stop signs on the road, everyone would just continue driving forward forever without recognizing that there is a need to stop driving, look both ways, and then proceed in another direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the block of operations to be performed __IF__ the condition is met (true) is indented to the right. Python will also be angry if you forget that indent; luckily VSC will indent for you automatically when you include the colon.  So get the first part right, and you should automatically get the second part right as well!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## else\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the print operation is only performed if the condition is true. So, what if you wanted to print something if the condition fails? Like to tell them \"Sorry, but you don't have enough money.\" This is where the `else` keyword comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person_money = 8\n",
    "\n",
    "if person_money >= 10:\n",
    "  print(\"This person can watch the movie\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "  print(\"Sorry, but you don't have enough money\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the above code will be `\"Sorry, but you don't have enough money\"`, because `person_money` is __not__ greater than or equal to 10. It is something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, both possible outcomes are handled above: they either have enough money, or they don't. Either way, the appropriate message is printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax for else\n",
    "\n",
    "The `else` statement is aligned with the `if` statement (the indentation is the same). In addition, the operation that is performed for the `else` block is indented like for the `if` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `else` statement also requires the use of the colon after the keyword. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## elif\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if there are more than two possible outcomes, you can use the `elif` statement. Consider the following scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If your age is 18 or higher, you can watch R-rated movies. If your age is 13 or higher, you can watch PG13-rated movies. If your age is less than 13, you can only watch G-rated movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you'll find the Python code to represent the above:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person_age = 18\n",
    "\n",
    "if person_age >= 18:\n",
    "  print(\"I can watch an R-rated movie\")\n",
    "elif person_age >= 13:\n",
    "  print(\"I can watch a PG13-rated movie\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "  print(\"I can watch a G-rated movie\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `elif` statement is essentially a combination of two words: _else_ and _if_. Like an `if` statement, a condition test must follow the `elif` statement. And, like both `if` and `else`, a colon must reside at the end of the line for `elif` statements. Similarly, the operations must be indented like the other blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order in which you test the conditions can matter. The output from the above example is \"I can watch an R-rated movie\", which is what you would expect given the value of `person_age` (18). However, what happens if you change the order of condition tests?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person_age = 13\n",
    "\n",
    "if person_age >= 13:\n",
    "  print(\"I can watch a PG13-rated movie\")\n",
    "elif person_age >= 18:\n",
    "  print(\"I can watch an R-rated movie\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "  print(\"I can watch a G-rated movie\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the above would be \"I can watch a PG13-rated movie\", which is different than the previous example. This is due to the change in sequence of the checks. Since the first condition (`person_age >= 13`) is true, it succeeds, printing out the message about the PG-13 movie. The remainder of the checks are skipped, because the first one was satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, try the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person_age = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "if person_age >= 18:\n",
    "  print(\"I can watch an R-rated movie\")\n",
    "elif person_age >= 13:\n",
    "  print(\"I can watch a PG13-rated movie\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "  print(\"I can watch a G-rated movie\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the first test is whether the age is >= 18, which is false (5 < 18). So, it moves to the next test. However, this test fails, as well, since 5 is less than 13. Thus, the final `else` block is hit and the print operation is performed (there is no test for the final else).\n"
