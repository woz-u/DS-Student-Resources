    "\n",
    "1. First, open up your command prompt (Windows) or your terminal (Mac/Linux)\n",
    "    - For Windows, navigate to your search bar in the bottom left hand corner. Type in `Command Prompt` and it should pop up. Click on `Command Prompt` and a separate window should appear on your screen.\n",
    "    - For Mac, press `command` and the space bar at the same time. Type in `terminal` and press `enter`. A separate Terminal window will pop up.\n",
    "2. Now that you are in your Command Prompt/Terminal, run the following command:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd desktop\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Next, move your command prompt/terminal's location to the new `python_course` you just created by running the following:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd python_course\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "4. Create a _new_ directory within the `python_course` directory. This new folder is the project you will be working in for this lesson. Run the following:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    mkdir lesson_four\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5. Open up a new window in VSCode.\n",
    "6. The first thing you should see a Welcome page. You can close this window.\n",
    "7. Now, its time to open the `lesson_four` directory. Click on the \"Explorer\" button on the left-hand side of the VSCode window.\n",
    "8. You will now see a button that says `Open Folder`, as shown below. Click this button.\n",
    "9. A new window will open that will allow you to search for files and folders. Locate the `python_course` folder you just created on your Desktop. Click on that folder and then locate the `lesson_four` folder. Select the `lesson_four` directory and click the `Open` button.\n",
    "10. Create a new file named `main.py` by one of the following three ways:\n",
    "    - To the right of __LESSON_FOUR__ in the EXPLORER is a button that looks like a piece of paper with a plus symbol in its top-left corner. If you hover your mouse over this button for a moment, a popup will appear indicating that this button will create a new file.\n",
    "    - Choose `File > New File` from the app's menu.\n",
    "    - Press `Control + N` in Windows or `Command + N` on a Mac (the plus means \"and at the same time\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the `main.py` file is created, you are ready to go! As you work through this lesson, add the code examples into your project so you can see the output yourself. Remember, to see the output within the VSCode terminal, right-click within your file and choose \"Run Python File in Terminal\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of this new project is for you to practice your new skills. It is highly recommended that you add the code from this lesson into your `lesson_four` project as you learn it. As you are going through this lesson and adding code to your project, you may find it helpful to include `comments` with a brief sentence explaining what is going on in the code. That way, you will have an easy reference to the topics explained in this lesson. Happy coding!\n"

    "# Key Value Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in NoSQL, Python can store information in key value pairs.  The *key* is the overarching bucket (think variable), which holds a *value* or an instance of something.  In Python, the data storage type that uses key value pairs is called a *dictionary*. The values associated with a key can be a number, string, list, or even another dictionary. You can use any object that you can create in Python as a value in your dictionary. However, the keys are unique.  This means that keys must be an immutable, or unchangeable, data type such as a string, number, or tuple. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Format of a Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a dictionary is wrapped in curly braces `{}` and contains a series of key-value pairs inside of the curly braces. Each key is separated from its value by a colon `:`, and each key-value pair is separated by commas. Below is a generic example to show you how dictionaries are structured:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dictionary = { key1 : value1, key2 : value2 }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating an Empty Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like when there are times that you need empty lists, sometimes you may need an empty dictionary as well.  You can create an empty dictionary by using two curly braces `{}`, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "empty_dictionary = {}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dictionary Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, a dictionary is created to represent an employee:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "employee = {'name': 'Andrew', 'age': 29, 'position': 'Engineer'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What about an address?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "address = {'city': 'Scottsdale', 'state': 'AZ', 'zip': '85258'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above examples, `employee` and `address` are the variables that will contain the dictionary values (the curly braces and everything in between).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dictionaries contain keys and their associated values. In the first example, there are three keys: `name`, `age`, and `position`. Two of the values associated with the keys are strings, while one is a number. Each key-value pair is specified as <b>&lt;key&gt;: &lt;value&gt;</b>, and the collection of key-value pairs are separated with commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no limit (beyond computer memory) to how many key-value pairs you can store in a dictionary. You can even add key-value pairs where the value is empty!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## dict() Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Another mechanism for creating a dictionary involves using the `dict()` function. When using the `dict()` command, the format of the input is different, as you can see in the example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_dict = dict(name='john', age=19, hometown='Phoenix')\n",
    "print(new_dict)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**OUTPUT:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{'name': 'john', 'age': 19, 'hometown': 'Phoenix'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, you can see that Python automatically formatted the input to the `dict()` command into a dictionary. The key-value pairs were not written as <b>&lt;key&gt;: &lt;value&gt;</b> like you saw earlier; instead, they were done as assignments <b>&lt;key&gt;= &lt;value&gt;</b>. Further, did you notice how the keys have no quotes around them, even though they are strings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is one more example of the `dict()` function being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dictionary = dict([(1, 'John'), (2, 'Andrew')])\n",
    "print(dictionary)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**OUTPUT:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{1: 'John', 2: 'Andrew'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, Python reads the dict function and formats the dictionary appropriately. This time, the keys that were used were integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"panel panel-warning\">\n",
    "    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n",
    "        <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Try It Yourself!</h3>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n",
    "        <p>Go ahead and write three dictionaries of your own. They can be anything, just make sure they have key-value pairs!</p>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Best Practice Dictionary Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "You may often see dictionaries formatted to write each key value pair on its own line.  This is a best practice in formatting to make your code more readable for other programmers/people. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "contact = {\n",
    "    'first_name': 'Henry',\n",
    "    'last_name': 'Poldark',\n",
    "    'phone_number': '(123)-456-7890',\n",
    "    'street': 'N 90th St',\n",
    "    'city': 'Scottsdale',\n",
    "    'state': 'Arizona',\n",
    "    'zip_code': '85258'\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, since the key-value pairs are enclosed within curly braces `{}`, the indentation of each line is not critical. However, it is a good practice to line things up so that they are easier to read.\n"
