    "## Regression\n",
    "Regression analysis is one of the most important fields in statistics and machine learning. There are many regression methods available. Linear regression is one of them.\n",
    "[Reference:](https://realpython.com/linear-regression-in-python/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is Regression?\n",
    "Regression searches for relationships among variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can observe several employees of some company and try to understand how their salaries depend on the __features__, such as experience, level of education, role, city they work in, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a regression problem where data related to each employee represent one __observation__. The presumption is that the experience, education, role, and city are the independent features, while the salary depends on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, you can try to establish a mathematical dependence of the prices of houses on their areas, numbers of bedrooms, distances to the city center, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, in regression analysis, you usually consider some phenomenon of interest and have a number of observations. Each observation has two or more features. Following the assumption that (at least) one of the features depends on the others, you try to establish a relation among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, you need to find a function that maps some features or variables to others sufficiently well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dependent features are called the dependent variables, outputs, or responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The independent features are called the independent variables, inputs, or predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression problems usually have one continuous and unbounded dependent variable. The inputs, however, can be continuous, discrete, or even categorical data such as gender, nationality, brand, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a common practice to denote the outputs with 𝑦 and inputs with 𝑥. If there are two or more independent variables, they can be represented as the vector 𝐱 = (𝑥₁, …, 𝑥ᵣ), where 𝑟 is the number of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Do You Need Regression?\n",
    "Typically, you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related. For example, you can use it to determine if and to what extent the experience or gender impact salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is also useful when you want to forecast a response using a new set of predictors. For example, you could try to predict electricity consumption of a household for the next hour given the outdoor temperature, time of day, and number of residents in that household.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is used in many different fields: economy, computer science, social sciences, and so on. Its importance rises every day with the availability of large amounts of data and increased awareness of the practical value of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression techniques. It’s among the simplest regression methods. One of its main advantages is the ease of interpreting results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Formulation\n",
    "When implementing linear regression of some dependent variable 𝑦 on the set of independent variables 𝐱 = (𝑥₁, …, 𝑥ᵣ), where 𝑟 is the number of predictors, you assume a linear relationship between 𝑦 and 𝐱: 𝑦 = 𝛽₀ + 𝛽₁𝑥₁ + ⋯ + 𝛽ᵣ𝑥ᵣ + 𝜀. This equation is the regression equation. 𝛽₀, 𝛽₁, …, 𝛽ᵣ are the regression coefficients, and 𝜀 is the random error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression calculates the estimators of the regression coefficients or simply the predicted weights, denoted with 𝑏₀, 𝑏₁, …, 𝑏ᵣ. They define the estimated regression function 𝑓(𝐱) = 𝑏₀ + 𝑏₁𝑥₁ + ⋯ + 𝑏ᵣ𝑥ᵣ. This function should capture the dependencies between the inputs and output sufficiently well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated or predicted response, 𝑓(𝐱ᵢ), for each observation 𝑖 = 1, …, 𝑛, should be as close as possible to the corresponding actual response 𝑦ᵢ. The differences 𝑦ᵢ - 𝑓(𝐱ᵢ) for all observations 𝑖 = 1, …, 𝑛, are called the residuals. Regression is about determining the best predicted weights, that is the weights corresponding to the smallest residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the best weights, you usually minimize the sum of squared residuals (SSR) for all observations 𝑖 = 1, …, 𝑛: SSR = Σᵢ(𝑦ᵢ - 𝑓(𝐱ᵢ))². This approach is called the method of ordinary least squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression Performance\n",
    "The variation of actual responses 𝑦ᵢ, 𝑖 = 1, …, 𝑛, occurs partly due to the dependence on the predictors 𝐱ᵢ. However, there is also an additional inherent variance of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient of determination, denoted as 𝑅², tells you which amount of variation in 𝑦 can be explained by the dependence on 𝐱 using the particular regression model. Larger 𝑅² indicates a better fit and means that the model can better explain the variation of the output with different inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value 𝑅² = 1 corresponds to SSR = 0, that is to the perfect fit since the values of predicted and actual responses fit completely to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "Simple or single-variate linear regression is the simplest case of linear regression with a single independent variable, 𝐱 = 𝑥.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure illustrates simple linear regression:\n",
    "![simple linear regression](https://files.realpython.com/media/fig-lin-reg.a506035b654a.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing simple linear regression, you typically start with a given set of input-output (𝑥-𝑦) pairs (green circles). These pairs are your observations. For example, the leftmost observation (green circle) has the input 𝑥 = 5 and the actual output (response) 𝑦 = 5. The next one has 𝑥 = 15 and 𝑦 = 20, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated regression function (black line) has the equation 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑏₀ + 𝑏₁𝑥. Your goal is to calculate the optimal values of the predicted weights 𝑏₀ and 𝑏₁ that minimize SSR and determine the estimated regression function. The value of 𝑏₀, also called the intercept, shows the point where the estimated regression line crosses the 𝑦 axis. It is the value of the estimated response 𝑓(𝑥) for 𝑥 = 0. The value of 𝑏₁ determines the slope of the estimated regression line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predicted responses (red squares) are the points on the regression line that correspond to the input values. For example, for the input 𝑥 = 5, the predicted response is 𝑓(5) = 8.33 (represented with the leftmost red square).\n",
    "\n",
    "The residuals (vertical dashed gray lines) can be calculated as 𝑦ᵢ - 𝑓(𝐱ᵢ) = 𝑦ᵢ - 𝑏₀ - 𝑏₁𝑥ᵢ for 𝑖 = 1, …, 𝑛. They are the distances between the green circles and red squares. When you implement linear regression, you are actually trying to minimize these distances and make the red squares as close to the predefined green circles as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "Multiple or multivariate linear regression is a case of linear regression with two or more independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are just two independent variables, the estimated regression function is 𝑓(𝑥₁, 𝑥₂) = 𝑏₀ + 𝑏₁𝑥₁ + 𝑏₂𝑥₂. It represents a regression plane in a three-dimensional space. The goal of regression is to determine the values of the weights 𝑏₀, 𝑏₁, and 𝑏₂ such that this plane is as close as possible to the actual responses and yield the minimal SSR.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case of more than two independent variables is similar, but more general. The estimated regression function is 𝑓(𝑥₁, …, 𝑥ᵣ) = 𝑏₀ + 𝑏₁𝑥₁ + ⋯ +𝑏ᵣ𝑥ᵣ, and there are 𝑟 + 1 weights to be determined when the number of inputs is 𝑟.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polynomial Regression\n",
    "You can regard polynomial regression as a generalized case of linear regression. You assume the polynomial dependence between the output and inputs and, consequently, the polynomial estimated regression function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, in addition to linear terms like 𝑏₁𝑥₁, your regression function 𝑓 can include non-linear terms such as 𝑏₂𝑥₁², 𝑏₃𝑥₁³, or even 𝑏₄𝑥₁𝑥₂, 𝑏₅𝑥₁²𝑥₂, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest example of polynomial regression has a single independent variable, and the estimated regression function is a polynomial of degree 2: 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑏₀ + 𝑏₁𝑥 + 𝑏₂𝑥².\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, remember that you want to calculate 𝑏₀, 𝑏₁, and 𝑏₂, which minimize SSR. These are your unknowns!\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping this in mind, compare the previous regression function with the function 𝑓(𝑥₁, 𝑥₂) = 𝑏₀ + 𝑏₁𝑥₁ + 𝑏₂𝑥₂ used for linear regression. They look very similar and are both linear functions of the unknowns 𝑏₀, 𝑏₁, and 𝑏₂. This is why you can solve the polynomial regression problem as a linear problem with the term 𝑥² regarded as an input variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of two variables and the polynomial of degree 2, the regression function has this form: 𝑓(𝑥₁, 𝑥₂) = 𝑏₀ + 𝑏₁𝑥₁ + 𝑏₂𝑥₂ + 𝑏₃𝑥₁² + 𝑏₄𝑥₁𝑥₂ + 𝑏₅𝑥₂². The procedure for solving the problem is identical to the previous case. You apply linear regression for five inputs: 𝑥₁, 𝑥₂, 𝑥₁², 𝑥₁𝑥₂, and 𝑥₂². What you get as the result of regression are the values of six weights which minimize SSR: 𝑏₀, 𝑏₁, 𝑏₂, 𝑏₃, 𝑏₄, and 𝑏₅.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are more general problems, but this should be enough to illustrate the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Underfitting and Overfitting\n",
    "One very important question that might arise when you’re implementing polynomial regression is related to the choice of the optimal degree of the polynomial regression function.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no straightforward rule for doing this. It depends on the case. You should, however, be aware of two problems that might follow the choice of the degree: underfitting and overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting occurs when a model can’t accurately capture the dependencies among data, usually as a consequence of its own simplicity. It often yields a low 𝑅² with known data and bad generalization capabilities when applied with new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting happens when a model learns both dependencies among data and random fluctuations. In other words, a model learns the existing data too well. Complex models, which have many features or terms, are often prone to overfitting. When applied to known data, such models usually yield high 𝑅². However, they often don’t generalize well and have significantly lower 𝑅² when used with new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next figure illustrates the underfitted, well-fitted, and overfitted models:\n",
    "![underfitted, well-fitted, and overfitted models](https://files.realpython.com/media/poly-reg.5790f47603d8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The top left plot shows a linear regression line that has a low 𝑅². It might also be important that a straight line can’t take into account the fact that the actual response increases as 𝑥 moves away from 25 towards zero. This is likely an example of underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top right plot illustrates polynomial regression with the degree equal to 2. In this instance, this might be the optimal degree for modeling this data. The model has a value of 𝑅² that is satisfactory in many cases and shows trends nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom left plot presents polynomial regression with the degree equal to 3. The value of 𝑅² is higher than in the preceding cases. This model behaves better with known data than the previous ones. However, it shows some signs of overfitting, especially for the input values close to 60 where the line starts decreasing, although actual data don’t show that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, on the bottom right plot, you can see the perfect fit: six points and the polynomial line of the degree 5 (or higher) yield 𝑅² = 1. Each actual response equals its corresponding prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some situations, this might be exactly what you’re looking for. In many cases, however, this is an overfitted model. It is likely to have poor behavior with unseen data, especially with the inputs larger than 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it assumes, without any evidence, that there is a significant drop in responses for 𝑥 > 50 and that 𝑦 reaches zero for 𝑥 near 60. Such behavior is the consequence of excessive effort to learn and fit the existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of resources where you can find more information about regression in general and linear regression in particular. The regression analysis page on Wikipedia, Wikipedia’s linear regression article, as well as Khan Academy’s linear regression article are good starting points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing Linear Regression in Python\n",
    "It’s time to start implementing linear regression in Python. Basically, all you should do is apply the proper packages and their functions and classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Packages for Linear Regression\n",
    "The package NumPy is a fundamental Python scientific package that allows many high-performance operations on single- and multi-dimensional arrays. It also offers many mathematical routines. Of course, it’s open source.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re not familiar with NumPy, you can use the official NumPy User Guide and read Look Ma, No For-Loops: Array Programming With NumPy. In addition, Pure Python vs NumPy vs TensorFlow Performance Comparison can give you a pretty good idea on the performance gains you can achieve when applying NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The package scikit-learn is a widely used Python library for machine learning, built on top of NumPy and some other packages. It provides the means for preprocessing data, reducing dimensionality, implementing regression, classification, clustering, and more. Like NumPy, scikit-learn is also open source.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check the page Generalized Linear Models on the scikit-learn web site to learn more about linear models and get deeper insight into how this package works.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to implement linear regression and need the functionality beyond the scope of scikit-learn, you should consider statsmodels. It’s a powerful Python package for the estimation of statistical models, performing tests, and more. It’s open source as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more information on statsmodels on its official web site.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Linear Regression With scikit-learn\n",
    "Let’s start with the simplest case, which is simple linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five basic steps when you’re implementing linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the packages and classes you need.\n",
    "2. Provide data to work with and eventually do appropriate transformations.\n",
    "3. Create a regression model and fit it with existing data.\n",
    "4. Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory.\n",
    "5. Apply the model for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps are more or less general for most of the regression approaches and implementations."
